      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan would like to think he's been through a lot in life and nothing really fazes him anymore. He owns one of the country's largest companies and he's got enough money to supply his son's recent (and worrying) gaming addiction. His beautiful wife is back home, one hundred percent recovered and the epitome of good health. Jin Ling has finally settled into his new school and Wei Ying reassures him he's stopped picking fights with anyone that glares in his direction. Everything is as it should be.</p>

      <p>Still, there's something that's been bothering him...</p>

      <p>“Dad, what's wrong?” Jin Ling asks, his voice lowered into a whisper.</p>

      <p>Even though they're the only people in his house right now, Zixuan still glances over his shoulder to make sure no one, and absolutely <em>no one </em>, will hear them.</p>

      <p>“A-Ling, before I tell you, I need you to promise me that you <em>won't </em>tell anyone about this, not your mother, not your uncles, not Sizhui or Jingyi—not even <em>Fairy</em>, got it?”</p>

      <p>“It's not like Fairy can—”</p>

      <p>“I. Said. Don't. Tell. Anyone. <em>Especially </em>your mother!”</p>

      <p>Zixuan tries to ignore his son subtly rolling his eyes. Spending so much time with Jiang Cheng has given him an attitude, but Zixuan won't deny the fact he used to have an attitude like that when he was around Jin Ling's age. Maybe it runs in the family.</p>

      <p>“Okay, okay! I promise!” Jin Ling huffs. He stands up straighter and gazes up at him with wide, waiting eyes. “What is it?”</p>

      <p>Zixuan takes a deep breath. To be safe, he checks over his shoulder again to make sure Yanli isn't anywhere in sight. (She wouldn't be; she's with her brothers right now, but it doesn't hurt to be safe.)</p>

      <p>Once he's one hundred and ten percent certain she's not here, he leans closer to his son and reveals his master plan.</p>

      <p>“I'm going to propose to your mother.”</p>

      <p>Jin Ling steps back, frowning. “But you're already married.”</p>

      <p>“I meant again!” Zixuan holds his head in his palms. “I'm going to propose again... so we can renew our vows.”</p>

      <p>“<em>Oh..”</em></p>

      <p>Zixuan sighs deeply, looking away. His eyes land on a large photo hanging on their wall. It's from their last wedding, taken before <em>everything </em>happened. Looking at the photo, you wouldn't think that Yanli fell into a coma for over a decade hours after that was taken.</p>

      <p>It's been years since it happened and Zixuan's long stopped pointing fingers at who was to blame. For ages, he hated Wei Ying; he thought, maybe if they never invited him, then Yanli would have returned home and they would have been free to live their married life in peace.</p>

      <p>Hating Wei Ying wouldn't have done anything though. It wouldn't have given his wife back, and it wouldn't have helped him bring Jin Ling up without a mother. Instead of hating Wei Ying, he did his best to do what he could for his family. Time passed, Jin Ling grew up, and Yanli remained comatose for years and years and years. At some point in his life, Zixuan worried that she would never wake up. The thought of having to make the decision to let her go one day terrified him. He'd heard of stories where family members of comatose patients eventually decided to turn off their life support, having accepted that they would never recover.</p>

      <p>That thought haunted him for years. He couldn't let Yanli go, but was it right for him to keep her, if it meant she was only suffering?</p>

      <p>He grinds his teeth together and forces himself to stop looking at the wedding photo. None of that matters anymore. He never had to make that decision. All that matters is that Yanli's back home and they have the rest of their lives to look forward to.</p>

      <p>“Our last wedding didn't go according to plan,” he mutters, turning back to his son. Jin Ling is also staring up at the photo. “Now that your mother is back, I want to give her the wedding she really wanted. What do you think?”</p>

      <p>“Me? I think it's a good idea. It's not like she's going to say no...” Jin Ling shrugs. “How are you going to propose to her?”</p>

      <p>Good question. How <em>is </em>he going to propose to Yanli again?</p>

      <p>Zixuan folds his arms, frowning up at the ceiling.</p>

      <p>“Hmm... I don't know yet, but I'll think of something,” he mumbles. “I want it to be special. I don't want to just do it out of nowhere.”</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>One hour later, Zixuan is too busy staring at Yanli's face to pay attention to what she's saying. In the back of his mind, he sees her gesturing towards the assortment of food she's prepared for tonight's dinner. As usual, her smile is patient and lovely. Even after he blinks at her in confusion, she only giggles into her hand.</p>

      <p>“I said what do you want?” she slowly repeats.</p>

      <p>Dinner is the last thing on his mind. Zixuan finds himself blanking out again, only focusing on the small dimple on Yanli's cheek. It's been three months since she returned home. Three months and he's still not over the fact that she's here, and she's okay. How did he last all those years without her? The thought of not being able to see her face greeting him every morning is impossible.</p>

      <p>“A-Xuan?” Yanli calls. “What do you want?”</p>

      <p>Zixuan, like any coherent husband in love, blurts out the first thing on his mind.</p>

      <p>“I want to marry you again.”</p>

      <p>It's only when Jin Ling starts choking on his piece of pork does he realise what he just said.</p>

      <p>Yanli blinks, almost dropping the bowl of rice she's holding. “Huh?”</p>

      <p><em>Shit.</em> <em>Why</em> is he such an <em>idiot?!</em></p>

      <p>Groaning, Zixuan covers his face because he <em>knows </em>he's already gone red. So much for proposing to her properly!</p>

      <p>In the corner of his eyes, he can see Jin Ling trying – and failing – not to laugh. In his defence, he does hold it in for a few seconds, but ends up choking on his food after. Yanli, ever the patient woman that she is, waits until Jin Ling stops spluttering, and until Zixuan gathers the courage to look in her direction again.</p>

      <p>As soon as he's sure he's no longer the same shade as a tomato, Zixuan faces his wife. Much to his dismay, there's a glint of amusement in her eyes.</p>

      <p>He sighs, pushing aside what's left of his pride—if there's any left by this point. “I... I want to marry you again,” he says. “A-Li, let's renew our vows.”</p>

      <p>She looks at him for the longest time, long enough for Zixuan to start wondering if this was a good idea. What if renewing their vows will only bring back bad memories for her? What if he'd just be forcing her to relive that day again? What if—</p>

      <p>Yanli interrupts the stampede of his thoughts with a giggle. “Nothing would make me happier,” she says, beaming at him.</p>

      <p>Zixuan spends a few more minutes spacing out, mentally celebrating because – <em>YES – </em>she accepted! They'll get married again! This time, he'll give her the best wedding ever; the wedding she's always wanted. In the space of several seconds, his mind is already racing with a billion ideas.</p>

      <p>“<em>Dad,” </em>Jin Ling calls out, waving a hand in front of his face.</p>

      <p>Zixuan blinks. Yanli is hiding another laugh behind her hand.</p>

      <p>Coughing, he forces his thoughts to focus on the present.</p>

      <p>“I want it to be the wedding you've always dreamed of,” he says. “Just tell me what you want and I'll arrange everything.”</p>

      <p>Yanli purses her lips together in thought. As far as he knows, she's always preferred sticking to traditions. Unlike the rest of his family, who had a ridiculous amount of crazy wedding ideas, Zixuan didn't care. Sure, he wanted a large, extravagant venue, but as long as Yanli was happy then that was what mattered the most...</p>

      <p>“Well... When I was in hospital, I actually had a strange dream about this...” Yanli says. “I remember overhearing some of the nurses talking about these celebrities who got married in Las Vegas... It left such an impression on me that I had the same dream for days.”</p>

      <p>She trails off into a laugh, but all Zixuan hears is the word <em>'Vegas' </em>and he's suddenly got a bad feeling about this.</p>

      <p>“What was the dream...?” he asks slowly.</p>

      <p>“We got married in Vegas and invited everyone.” Yanli taps her chin in thought, too preoccupied to notice the utter confusion on her husband's face. “In my dream, we invited everyone we knew and had the biggest wedding in one of the casinos there. It would be so good to see everyone together.”</p>

      <p>Yanli's smile remains in place while Zixuan struggles to come into terms with the direction this conversation has gone to. When he decided he wanted to renew his vows, he expected another traditional wedding ceremony—maybe <em>not </em>exactly the same as their last wedding, but at least similar. The last thing he expected was to hear the words 'Vegas' and 'casino' to come out of his wife's mouth.</p>

      <p>“You... want to get married in Vegas?” he repeats.</p>

      <p>Yanli quickly shakes her head, laughing. “It's probably too much. I'm being overambitious; it was only a silly dream.”</p>

      <p>Zixuan shakes his head as well, plastering a wide smile on his face. “No, no! Like I said, I'll arrange anything” He glances down at the plate of food he hasn't touched. Now that he thinks about it, maybe he <em>can </em>do something... “I have a friend in Vegas who owns a casino anyway... I can contact him.”</p>

      <p>'Friend' is pushing it. This guy was a business partner he had several years ago, but it never hurts to keep connections open. If he can remember correctly, this guy owns one of the largest and most expensive casinos in America... If Yanli wants a wedding in Vegas of all places, then Zixuan is going to make sure she's going to get the best wedding in Vegas.</p>

      <p>He turns back to his wife, flashing her a genuine grin. “Leave it to me.”</p>

      <p>Yanli beams at him. In the corner of his eye, he ignores Jin Ling looking at both of them like they've gone insane.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng chokes on his coffee. He slams it down on the table, thumping his chest as he splutters. “She wants to get married in <em>where? </em>”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan sighs, massaging the temples of his forehead. “A casino. In Vegas.”</p>

      <p>A casino. In Vegas. He lets that sink into him as he catches his breath again, ignoring the curious glances he's receiving around the café. After a few more minutes, Jiang Cheng notices some teenage girl is <em>still </em>sneaking glances at their table. Apparently, it's not everyday you hear about someone wanting to get married in Vegas.</p>

      <p>Irritated, he shoots her a glare until she finally looks away. Damn teenagers have nothing better to do than listen to other people's conversations.</p>

      <p>Anyway. Back to the matter at hand. Has his sister even set foot in a casino before? And <em>why </em>a casino of all places? This is the sort of crazy thing he'd expect Wei Ying to pull off, not A-Jie!</p>

      <p>Speaking of Wei Ying, he noisily slurps at his bubble tea, breaking the thick silence that's fallen across the table.</p>

      <p>“I've had enough of casinos to last me a lifetime,” he mutters, enough for Jiang Cheng to hear.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng clenches his jaw and does his best to push the memories of their last casino trip out of his head. Considering Wei Ying literally died, Jiang Cheng's not surprised he's in no hurry to return to a casino any time soon.</p>

      <p>He pushes his coffee back, frowning at Jin Zixuan. “You couldn't have suggested something else to change her mind?” he asks.</p>

      <p>They never told their sister about what really happened with the Wens. As wrong as it is to hide things from her, Jiang Cheng didn't know where to start... How do you even tell your sister about something like that?</p>

      <p><em>Hey, welcome back, A-Jie. Nah, you didn't miss much. Just Wei Ying being abducted by a gang and getting shot to death—but it's okay, because his immortal boyfriend brought him back to life!</em></p>

      <p>Yeah, no. That wasn't going to work.</p>

      <p>Besides, Wei Ying hasn't said anything either. Both brothers came to a silent agreement that the less their sister – or anyone – knows about this, the better.</p>

      <p>“If it's what she wants, then I'm not going to stop her,” Zixuan says. “Besides, I know someone in Vegas who owns one of the best casinos there. The venue's good.”</p>

      <p>Of course he would. Sometimes, Jiang Cheng forgets that the Jins used to live in America before choosing to settle down here.</p>

      <p>If Jin Zixuan knows someone, then at least Jiang Cheng can be sure his sister isn't going to get married at a random place in the middle of Vegas. After all, the Jins are stupidly rich. This casino owner is probably just as rich as them.</p>

      <p>He lets out a defeated sigh and shrugs to himself. What else can he do? If A-Jie wants a wedding at the other side of the world, then they'll have to go along with it.</p>

      <p>Tired, Jiang Cheng shoves his hand into his pocket and fishes his phone out. Wei Ying's started talking to Jin Zixuan about something and Jiang Cheng can't be bothered to listen to them. Beside him, Xichen is quietly drinking his tea, occasionally looking over Jiang Cheng's shoulder to see what he's scrolling through on his phone. Lan Wangji is also here, sitting next to Wei Ying—but fuck knows what that guy is doing.</p>

      <p>Ever since Jiang Cheng and Wei Ying started talking again, Jiang Cheng's also been seeing a lot more of Lan Wangji. He's happy Wei Ying's found someone who can actually put up with how annoying he is, but how the hell does he even talk to this guy? Every time Jiang Cheng sees Lan Wangji, he's always silent or emotionally dead. Or both. Meanwhile, Wei Ying will be right beside him, talking his ear off about anything that comes across his mind.</p>

      <p>They're the strangest couple Jiang Cheng's ever seen—but, again, at least Wei Ying's found someone who can put up with him.</p>

      <p>To pass the time, Jiang Cheng opens up Instagram and quickly scrolls through his feed. A-Jie's posted another picture of something she cooked last night. Jiang Cheng likes the photo, smiling at her caption.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the smile is wiped off his face as soon as he scrolls down and sees what Wei Ying uploaded an hour ago. At first glance, it looks like any selfie he posted with Lan Wangji. Jiang Cheng's used to being spammed with their couples selfies. Half of Wei Ying's profile is endless photos of him with his boyfriend.</p>

      <p>The picture itself is okay. The caption, however, is not.</p>

      <img src="wxinstagram.png" alt="An instagram post with a selfie of Wei Wing and Lan Zhan. It is posted by user wei.cuterthanu in Gusu and liked by jiangyanli and 127 others. Lan Zhan is holding Wei Ying around the waist and one of Wei Ying's arms is around Lan Zhan's shoulder and flashing a peace sign. The other arm is taking the photo. The caption is: 'this selfie was taken before i got the dicking of my life ;) my ass still HURTS as i'm typing this xD'. Of 16 comments, 3 are visible. zewujun comments 'What a lovely photo! (✿ ❤‿❤)'. lanwangji comments 'I apologize for hurting you. I will be gentler next time.' j.cheng comments 'i'm literally going to fucking block you'.">

      <p>Jiang Cheng throws a glare at Wei Ying's direction, half tempted to chuck his phone at the shit-eating grin on his face. The fact that Wei Ying is smirking right now shows that he <em>knows </em>Jiang Cheng's currently looking at his abomination of a post! That bastard!</p>

      <p>Before Jiang Cheng can contemplate lunging across the table to strangle his annoying excuse for a brother, Wei Ying shuffles closer to Lan Wangji—as if that's going to save him.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Jiang Cheng resists the urge to bodily harm Wei Ying. Instead, he scoffs and shoves his phone back into his pocket.</p>

      <p>“How will you even get everyone in Vegas?” Wei Ying asks Jin Zixuan, still clinging onto Lan Wangji's arm.</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan, who is unfortunate enough to be sitting next to the couple, shuffles to the side. He looks like he's slowly regretting joining them here in this café.</p>

      <p>“I have plenty of private jets...”</p>

      <p>“It will still be a long journey,” Xichen says.</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan already looks so tired, and the whole event hasn't even been properly arranged yet. He waves a hand towards all of them. “She wants it to be a big event, so invite everyone you know, and everyone <em>they </em>know.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying laughs. “Are you sure you have enough private jets?”</p>

      <p>At this, Jin Zixuan raises an eyebrow at him. Of course, that's enough of an answer. It was a dumb question to begin with.</p>

      <p>“Silly me, why am I doubting the amount of money you have?” Wei Ying rolls his eyes. “This isn't like Jiejie at all...”</p>

      <p>“Can A-Ling even come? Will he be allowed inside the casino?” Jiang Cheng says. Don't casinos have an age restriction? What kind of a wedding would it be if the couple's <em>son </em>can't come?</p>

      <p>“It's only a venue,” Jin Zixuan reassures. “It's not like we'll actually be gambling. Besides, my friend says it's fine.”</p>

      <p>“Which casino is it?” Wei Ying asks. “I might have heard of it.”</p>

      <p>“This one.” Holding up his phone, Jin Zixuan shows them a picture of a casino that looks more like a palace. “It's called <em>Heavenly Blessing </em>.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying whistles, grabbing Jin Zixuan's wrist to yank his phone closer. “Should have known it'd be this one,” he mumbles.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng frowns. “You've been there?”</p>

      <p>Smirking, Wei Ying pushes Jin Zixuan's arm away again and motions towards himself. “Me? You think I'm rich enough to enter that place? Hell no. I heard about it a lot when I stayed in Ohio though.”</p>

      <p>He has a good point there. Jiang Cheng will never understand how Wei Ying is still broke, even with his teaching job.</p>

      <p><em>Then again... </em>Jiang Cheng glances over at Lan Wangji, who has not said a single word since he arrived here. Aren't the Lans ridiculously rich? Xichen once told him that they kept a lot of money from all those years they spent as immortals. Wei Ying pretty much relies on Lan Wangji for his money now. The other day, Jiang Cheng spotted the couple shopping together; or in that case, Wei Ying was grabbing anything he could find while Lan Wangji had his credit card ready. Suffice to say, Jiang Cheng walked away, very unamused.</p>

      <p>“They call the owner the 'Demon King' because he's fucking terrifying,” Wei Ying goes on.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's not sure if he wants his sister to get married in a casino that's owned by someone who may or may not be possessed by demons.</p>

      <p>“I can't believe this...” he mutters under his breath. He expected Jin Zixuan and his sister might want another wedding, but no one could have guessed it would be in Vegas.</p>

      <p><em>Well, it's better than having it in the Nightless City, </em>he bitterly thinks. Not that they could. Ever since the incident with the Wens, that casino's been closed down. They're not sure if they're re-opening it any time soon. Jiang Cheng hopes they won't bother.</p>

      <p>“I guess after everything that's happened, A-Li's got it in her head that she wants to do something...”</p>

      <p>“Crazy?” Jiang Cheng offers, finishing Jin Zixuan's sentence for him.</p>

      <p>“Eh, if it's what she wants then we can't complain,” Wei Ying says. “It's not like I'll be the one paying for it anyway.” He turns to Lan Wangji with a coy smile creeping on his face. Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes as soon as Wei Ying strokes a hand up his chest. “Lan Zhan, do you remember the first time we went to America together? That was where our first date was!”</p>

      <p>“Hmm.” Lan Wangji nods, reaching down to tuck Wei Ying's hair behind his ears.</p>

      <p>It takes all of Jiang Cheng's self control not to gag. He does, however, not bother to hide the disgust on his face. He's happy his brother found someone who loves him, but can they seriously keep public displays of affection <em>away </em>from his eyes? If he has to see Wei Ying sucking out Lan Wangji's face one more time, he's going to lose his shit.</p>

      <p>“Why are you all here anyway?” he snaps. “Can you all go?”</p>

      <p>Confused, Jin Zixuan looks around them. The table they're all sitting in is far too small to fit two couples and one rich businessman. Jin Zixuan is squashed against a corner with Wei Ying practically sitting on Lan Wangji's lap. Xichen, on the other hand, is right next to Jiang Cheng, smiling politely at everyone.</p>

      <p>“I needed to talk to both of you. I thought you were all on some double date or whatever,” Jin Zixuan says.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng slams his hand down on the table so hard that all of their drinks wobble. Xichen grabs onto his coffee just in time before it falls over.</p>

      <p>“<em>No! </em>Xichen and I were celebrating our third month anniversary and they—” Jiang Cheng jabs a finger at Wei Ying and Lan Wangji. <strong>“</strong>—fucking joined us out of nowhere!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying throws his head back, cackling. “You two celebrate your monthly anniversaries? Jiang Cheng, that's actually cute.”</p>

      <p>Forget self control. Jiang Cheng lunges across the table, reaching for Wei Ying's neck—or he would have, if Xichen didn't grab onto his waist, pulling him back down.</p>

      <p>“Shut the fuck up!” he shrieks. “<em>Go! </em>Leave us alone!”</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Hectic planning and chaos aside, a month passes and, much to everyone's surprise, Jin Zixuan's Vegas wedding with Jiejie proceeds as planned. Wei Ying had no idea how he managed to organize everything in one month; not just the venue and the invitations, but also the arrangements to actually get all the guests to America in the first place. He doesn't even want to guess how much money this all cost.</p>

      <p>Considering how sudden this wedding was, Wei Ying doubted many people would be able to attend. After all, who has time to set aside their schedule to fly to America for one wedding? It's a miracle Shen Yuan let <em>him </em>off for the week in order to attend this.</p>

      <p>And so, Wei Ying got the shock of his life when he arrived at the ceremony. Jiejie's last wedding had been big—but this, this made it look tiny in comparison. Jin Zixuan wasn't exaggerating when he told people to invite everyone they knew.</p>

      <p>For their first wedding, Jiejie wanted to keep everything traditional. This time—well, the fact that they're having a wedding in a casino is probably enough to say this isn't like your typical ceremony at all.</p>

      <p>The renewal ceremony itself isn't as crazy as Wei Ying thought it would be. He was half expecting an Elvis impersonator to carry out the ceremony, but Jin Zixuan actually hired a minister to do it. Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng walk Jiejie down the aisle and, yes, Jiang Cheng <em>does </em>cry. No doubt he'll later deny it but Wei Ying <em>saw </em>him. He can't hide the truth!</p>

      <p>For the ceremony, Jiejie decided on wearing a white wedding dress with the longest train Wei Ying's seen in his life. He almost tripped over it while walking her down the aisle, but managed to save himself before that disaster happened. He knows she's got another dress later for the after-party. Unlike the first dress, it's red and form-fitting, and will most likely make Jin Zixuan qi deviate on the spot, if qi deviating is still possible.</p>

      <p>As Jin Zixuan and Jiejie recite their vows to each other, Wei Ying can't stop himself from comparing this wedding to their last. Back then, Jin Ling was only five years old. Now, he's a lanky teenager, trying very, very hard not to cry with Jiang Cheng. Wei Ying smiles, feeling tears sting at his own eyes.</p>

      <p>The years have been painfully long. Now that he's standing here, watching his sister get married again, he's overwhelmed at how much has changed.</p>

      <p>Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu are still dead, but Wei Ying no longer feels the crushing guilt of responsibility over their deaths. He watches Jiejie's smile get wider and wider with each word she recites and all he can do is smile with her. His cheeks hurt and the tears at his eyes roll down. He doesn't have the heart to wipe them away.</p>

      <p>Twelve years ago, he was an alcoholic who wasted himself away instead of admit that he needed someone, anyone, to help him. Twelve years ago, Jiang Cheng looked at him with hatred and disgust, vowing that any connections they had were forever gone. Twelve years ago, Wei Ying wanted to die. He would have never guessed that he'd live until thirty-three, reconciled with Jiang Cheng and watching Jiejie have the wedding she really deserved.</p>

      <p><em>Not only twelve years, </em>Wei Ying thinks. It's been more than twelve years—more than a lifetime. In his original life, he never got to attend his shijie's wedding. He killed Jin Zixuan and his lack of control over the resentful energy led to his own sister's death. Back then, he would have never <em>dreamed </em>of a second chance like this. He wouldn't have dared to even hope.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying ducks his head down, sniffing. In an instant, a hand gently lays on his shoulder. He doesn't have to look up to see who it is.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying?” Lan Zhan calls, a slight hint of concern in his quiet voice.</p>

      <p>Quickly, Wei Ying wipes his tears away and reassures him with a smile. He could get more emotional about how he and Lan Zhan have found each other again, but he's already done that so many times during these past three months. No matter how many times Wei Ying looks at Lan Zhan, it'll never stop amazing him that they actually have the rest of their lives to be with each other.</p>

      <p>But this is Jiejie's wedding. Wei Ying grins up at Lan Zhan and snuggles against his arm, watching the rest of the ceremony in silence. Everything is as it should be, and he couldn't be any more thankful.</p>

      <p>“You may now kiss the bride.”</p>

      <p>The minister barely finishes his sentence before Jin Zixuan is sweeping Jiejie into his arms and kissing her. Everyone erupts into cheers. Even Wei Ying has to smirk; he'll give the arrogant peacock some credit for today. In the corner of his eyes, he can see Lan Xichen handing Jiang Cheng some tissue. Wei Ying almost laughs when Jiang Cheng snatches it, quickly dabbing his eyes dry.</p>

      <p>After the ceremony, they all take pictures together. It's the most chaotic thing Wei Ying's experienced; trying to fit everyone into one shot – especially when Jin Zixuan decided to invite half the population of Gusu – is actually impossible. In the end, they give up and split into several groups. By this point, the photographer looks like he's about to quit his job.</p>

      <p>“Throw the bouquet! Throw the bouquet!” Lan Jingyi shrieks, just before Lan Qiren smacks him on the back.</p>

      <p>“Be quiet, Jingyi!” the old man hisses.</p>

      <p>Jiejie laughs and looks around. Everyone watches her, eyes poised on the huge bouquet of lavender and gold peonies she's holding.</p>

      <p>“Do I throw it now?” she asks. “I thought that was for later...”</p>

      <p>“Everyone's here already, Jiejie. You might as well throw it now,” Wei Ying tells her. He rolls his sleeves up his elbows and not so subtly pushes Wen Qing aside.</p>

      <p>“What are you <em>doing? </em>” Wen Qing glares, backing away from him. She's not the only one that Wei Ying gently shoves out of his path. He manages to push Mo Xuanyu as well, who dramatically stumbles into Wen Ning's arms.</p>

      <p>“Making sure I catch that thing,” Wei Ying says, grinning.</p>

      <p>Behind him, Jiang Cheng scoffs, no doubt also rolling his eyes.</p>

      <p>Jiejie lets out another laugh. She turns around, waving the large bouquet in the air. “Okay, okay. One... Two... <em>Three! </em>”</p>

      <p>The bouquet hurtles through the air in slow motion. There's a blinding flash of more pictures being taken and everyone scrambling to grab the flying bundle. Wei Ying watches as it rushes towards him... and over his head. He spins around in time to see Jiang Cheng catching it with one hand.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng blinks, staring at the bouquet in his hands. He doesn't move, and neither does anyone. The only sound that can be heard is the camera going off again, capturing this moment. For the next few seconds, Jiang Cheng's face is completely blank and he stands as still as a statue.</p>

      <p>Then, he jerks back as if he's been electrocuted. With a startled yelp, he throws it to Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>“Got it!” Wei Ying cries. “Lan Zhan, I got it! Jiejie, look!”</p>

      <p>Huaisang points at Jiang Cheng, who is staring at the bouquet like it's the most terrifying thing he's seen in his entire life. “Jiang Cheng caught it first!”</p>

      <p>“I-I don't want it! He can have the stupid thing!”</p>

      <p>Laughing, Wei Ying hooks an arm around Jiang Cheng and waves the flowers in front of him. As expected, Jiang Cheng tries to untangle himself away from him, but Wei Ying manages to hold on. “Hey, does that mean we're getting married together?”</p>

      <p>Pushing his luck, he grins over at Lan Xichen. The older Lan brother is staring at them with clear amusement in his dark eyes, shaking his head to himself.</p>

      <p>“Oi, Xichen-ge, what do you think of a double wedding?”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng elbows Wei Ying right in the ribs. <em>“Shut up!”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying allows himself to be shoved off, still laughing. He was only joking. As much as he loves annoying Jiang Cheng, Wei Ying wouldn't want a double wedding with him at all. If he's going to marry Lan Zhan, then they're going to have the cutest wedding ever. Now that he thinks about it, he wouldn't even mind what kind of wedding they had... As long as it's with Lan Zhan...</p>

      <p>Another flash of light pulls him away from his daydreams. Wei Ying blinks as his picture is taken, followed by a dozen more photos. Did Jin Zixuan hire a photographer or the paparazzi?</p>

      <p>Once enough photos are taken to fill a private museum, they move onto another room for the after-party. This place barely looks like a casino at all. On the outside, you'd mistake it for a random palace in the middle of Vegas, and the inside isn't any different either. The walls are all white marble, and there are towering, golden statues standing over them with every corner they pass. Each statue is at least <em>four times </em>the size of Wei Ying. Just walking past one of them makes him feel like an ant.</p>

      <p>They're led inside the room Jin Zixuan reserved. Unlike the other rooms, this one is much darker. The snow-white marble walls are gone, replaced by midnight-black wallpaper that makes this place look like it's permanently night time. It's not pitch black though; above them, lanterns cover the entirety of the ceiling, illuminating the room with a crimson glow.</p>

      <p>“Pretty...” Wei Ying mumbles, eyeing the red curtains draped all over the place. No wonder this casino is deemed the most expensive in Vegas. If Jin Zixuan hadn't told Wei Ying, he wouldn't even know this was a casino at all.</p>

      <p>As expected, the food is as good as the decorations. Wei Ying eats his entire body weight, all the while listening to the conversation dancing around the tables. He's not the least bit surprised to hear a few of the Jins whispering among themselves, their eyes fixed on him like they expect <em>something </em>to happen.</p>

      <p>Back then, they did the exact thing during Jiejie's first wedding. Rumours of him being an alcoholic were too good for them not to talk about. Wei Ying lost control of his temper instead of doing the sensible thing and ignoring them instead. If he had ignored them, then maybe Jiejie would have never had that accident.</p>

      <p>Sighing, Wei Ying shoves another chicken drumstick into his mouth. He can still feel their eyes on him.</p>

      <p>This time, though, he doesn't give a shit. He wipes his mouth clean with a napkin and pulls at Lan Zhan's arm.</p>

      <p>“Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, try this!” Wei Ying says, guiding a dumpling into his mouth. As Lan Zhan leans closer, Wei Ying can just about make out the Jins asking themselves <em>where </em>he managed to find a boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Ha! If the rumours are about him and his hot boyfriend, then Wei Ying actually doesn't mind that at all.</p>

      <p>For the rest of the banquet, Wei Ying ignores the rest of the Jins. After they're done eating, he walks around with Lan Zhan, looking for any friends they haven't managed to greet yet.</p>

      <p>“Geez, I don't even want to guess how much this place costs to book,” Wei Ying mumbles.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan smiles down at him. “Too much.”</p>

      <p>“Well, the owner of this place is apparently a friend of Jin Zixuan's, so is it any surprise that all of this is over the top?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan doesn't say anything, but his smile widens. It's the smile that he reserves for only Wei Ying. No matter how many times he does it, Wei Ying's heart <em>always </em>somersaults.</p>

      <p>As much as he wants to admire Lan Zhan's smile, something catches Wei Ying's eyes. He looks over Lan Zhan's shoulder, grimacing.</p>

      <p>“Your uncle's coming,” he says. Even from across the room, Wei Ying knows Lan Qiren is aiming that glare straight at him. Some things never change at all, even across centuries. “He doesn't look happy.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan sighs.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying pats him on the shoulder. “Better go to him before he passes out or anything.”</p>

      <p>Nodding, Lan Zhan kisses him on the forehead before he leaves to calm his uncle down. To be safe, Wei Ying scurries away from Lan Qiren's line of sight, not quite in the mood to be lectured by him today.</p>

      <p>Now that all the food's been eaten, everyone's separated into their little groups. There's so many guests that Wei Ying has trouble distinguishing them apart from each other. It doesn't help the room is only dimly lit, making it difficult to see <em>anything </em>at all. He’s aware Jiejie wanted a large wedding, but does she even know <em>half </em>of these guests?</p>

      <p>The first person he manages to find is Jin Zixuan. Oddly enough, he's also walking around by himself. His mother must have dragged Jiejie off somewhere.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying joins the groom, lightly patting him on the back. Surprised, Jin Zixuan raises an eyebrow at him.</p>

      <p>“I always heard this place was fancy, but I didn't expect it to be <em>this </em>big,” Wei Ying says.</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan smirks and folds his arms. “Stop underestimating how much money I have.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying reigns in the snide comment that wants to escape him. For today, he'll be nice to Jin Zixuan. “Where's the owner of this casino?”</p>

      <p>“Not sure. I think he's busy right now, but he said he'll come down later to greet us.”</p>

      <p>If the owner of this place is so scary that people call him the 'Demon King', then Wei Ying wants to see why. You don't get a reputation like that out of nowhere. Is he another dodgy gang leader? Some large, seven-foot man that's shaken fear to the entire population of Vegas? The possibilities are endless.</p>

      <p>A waitress walks over to them, offering a tray of drinks. Jin Zixuan smiles at her, helping himself to a glass of wine. He nods at Wei Ying. “You want any?”</p>

      <p>“No thanks, I've stopped drinking,” Wei Ying says, politely shaking his head at the waitress.</p>

      <p>“Ah. Good for you.” Jin Zixuan raises the glass to his lips. Before he can take a drink, the sound of his mother yelling echoes across the whole room. A quiet groan escapes his lips. He nods at Wei Ying again, offering him a forced smile. “Anyway, enjoy the rest of the party. And—” Jin Zixuan stops, as if thinking over his next words.</p>

      <p>In the end, he smiles again. This time, it's genuine. “Thanks for coming down.”</p>

      <p>“Why are you thanking me? Stop trying to be nice.” Wei Ying laughs at the inevitable scowl Jin Zixuan throws at him. “I should be thanking <em>you </em>for forcing me to visit Jiejie back then. You didn't have to do that. You could have... hated me.”</p>

      <p>“Don't flatter yourself. I did hate you.” Jin Zixuan looks down, shaking his head. “But I love A-li more. And besides... You're not so bad now.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying has to laugh again at that. He says it so quietly that you'd think it <em>hurt </em>to physically let those words out.</p>

      <p>“Alright, alright. Thanks, but I'm taken.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan's scowl is back. He gives a scoff of his own and waves goodbye, hurrying to his mother. Wei Ying watches him go and chuckles when he sees Aunt Jin ranting about something Jin Zixuan probably did. Some things really don't change.</p>

      <p>The sound of laughter distracts him. He follows the source of the sound, soon finding Mo Xuanyu cackling at... something. Curious, Wei Ying approaches him, also spotting the Wen siblings.</p>

      <p>Wen Qing half-heartedly waves at him. For once, her hair is down and not tied into a ponytail. She's also wearing red eyeshadow that matches her lipstick. She looks good, although the scowl on her face tells Wei Ying she's already ready to go home. Wen Ning, on the other hand, is staring at Mo Xuanyu with evident confusion on his face.</p>

      <p>“What's going on here?” Wei Ying asks.</p>

      <p>Wen Qing nods at Mo Xuanyu. “This kid can't take his alcohol.”</p>

      <p><em>Ah.</em></p>

      <p>As soon as Mo Xuanyu finishes laughing at whatever he was laughing at, he bounces to Wei Ying's side and hugs him so tight that Wei Ying's sure he's broken a few bones.</p>

      <p>He pats the younger man's head, gently pushing him away before he can break any more limbs. “Drunk already, Xuanyu? We haven't even been here for an hour yet.”</p>

      <p>As quickly as that, the grin on Mo Xuanyu's face drops. “I'm not drunk!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying might have believed him if he didn't trip over one second after he says that. Wen Ning catches him in time, safely directing him back to a chair.</p>

      <p>Sighing, Wei Ying turns back to Wen Qing. “You look like you could use a drink.”</p>

      <p>“And be like him? No thanks.”</p>

      <p>“No approval for your brother's boyfriend? That's harsh, Wen Qing.”</p>

      <p>“Nah, I'm happy for them. That kid makes A-Ning happy.” As she says this, they hear the distant sound of Mo Xuanyu tripping over something else. Wen Qing pinches the bridge of her nose and takes a deep, deep breath. “Anyway, where's your man? It's rare not to see both of you joined at the hip.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying spares a few seconds to scan the room. He can't see where Lan Zhan or Lan Qiren is. Come to think of it, he hasn't seen Lan Xichen either.</p>

      <p>He shrugs. They probably went to find a place that was quiet.</p>

      <p>“He's gone to greet his uncle.”</p>

      <p>“And <em>you're </em>hiding?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying smirks. “I came here to enjoy the party, not be lectured.”</p>

      <p>Wen Qing raises her eyebrows. “Lectured? What have you done now?”</p>

      <p>“Nothing! The old man's just got it in his head that I'm corrupting Lan Zhan.”</p>

      <p>“You did convince him to have sex with you in a parking lot.”</p>

      <p>He almost chokes. <em>That </em>was three months ago and Wen Qing still won't let him live it down!</p>

      <p>“That's <em>hardly </em>corrupting Lan Zhan. Besides, Lan Zhan was very eager about that.”</p>

      <p>As quick as lightning, Wen Qing covers her ears, turning her back to him. “I <em>don't </em>want to know the details.”</p>

      <p><em>“Actually—”</em></p>

      <p>A booming yell silences Wei Ying, followed by a bunch of people laughing.</p>

      <p>“God, how many people are already drunk at this party?” Wen Qing mutters. She cranes her head to see what all the commotion is about. It's difficult to really tell when there's so many groups and everyone is doing their own thing. “Isn't that... the famous actor, Jin Guangyao?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying follows where she's looking. Like she said, Meng Yao is standing near the cake, talking to Nie Mingjue. Lan Xichen is also there, laughing at something one of them has said.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng vaguely explained what happened between the three of them. Apparently, Lan Xichen had some complicating history with Meng Yao and Nie Mingjue. Wei Ying remembers they used to be sworn brothers, and that tension was high between Nie Mingjue and Jin Guangyao. Whatever happened between the three of them must have occurred after his own death. Wei Ying was already confused enough as it is with his past life, therefore he didn't want to pry into Lan Xichen's as well. By the looks of it, they resolved their differences though.</p>

      <p>“Why is he here?” Wen Qing asks.</p>

      <p>“He's Jin Zixuan's and Mo Xuanyu's half-brother, remember?” Wei Ying says.</p>

      <p>“<em>Ohh. </em>I keep forgetting they're related.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying feigns shock. “You haven't gone through that awkward stage where you need to meet the whole family of your brother's boyfriend?”</p>

      <p>“Says the one <em>avoiding </em>his boyfriend's uncle!” Wen Qing lightly pushes him, laughing under her breath. “No, this is the first time I've seen any of the Jins in person. I started watching Jin Guangyao's new drama the other day though; the one I kept telling you about.”</p>

      <p>Oh yeah, Wei Ying completely forgot about that. After Wen Ruohan's death, a lot of rumours about Meng Yao's career started to circulate. Most people expected him to give up acting, seeing as his manager was gone and many thought he was involved with the gang activities too. To everyone's surprise, Huaisang convinced his own company to hire Meng Yao. Now, both of them have started <em>another </em>drama together and all the shady business surrounding Wen Ruohan has been forgotten.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying taps his chin, trying to remember the title of their new drama. Like <em>Crimson Heart, </em>this new drama series also became widely popular. Wen Qing's been trying to persuade him to watch it with her for <em>weeks.</em></p>

      <p>“<em>The Untamed? </em>Is it <em>that </em>good?” he says, finally remembering the title. He's heard so many of his students talking about it. Lan Jingyi, in particular, is a big fan. “Maybe I'll watch it with you next time then—”</p>

      <p>Another loud boom of laughter tears through the room. This time, it's much closer. Too close. Wei Ying glances over his shoulder, not expecting Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen suddenly behind him.</p>

      <p>As soon as he sees him, Lan Xichen grabs his arm tightly. <em>Very </em>tightly. Wei Ying winces. The infamous Lan arm strength is still a thing! Even without cultivation, they're still ridiculously strong! It doesn't help that Lan Zhan and Lan Xichen actually started going to the gym on a regular basis with Nie Mingjue. After losing their cores, they thought it would be a good idea to regain their strength back—but Wei Ying thinks they've regained too much.</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen shakes him. “Teacher Wei!!! Teacher Wei!!!”</p>

      <p>Laughing nervously, Wei Ying tries his best to slowly pull his arm away. It doesn't budge.</p>

      <p>“Ah, Xichen-ge... I told you that you can call me Wei Ying...”</p>

      <p>“<em>Wei Ying!!! </em>Where's Wangji? Where's my didi?”</p>

      <p>Wait. Leaning back slightly, Wei Ying studies the almost-deranged excitement on the older man's face. Lan Xichen is smiling so much that you'd think world peace was just declared. He <em>knows </em>that look.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying turns to Meng Yao. “He's drunk.”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao nods. “And I have a headache.”</p>

      <p>In an instant, Lan Xichen's smile is gone. He's by Meng Yao's side within seconds, holding his head in his hands.</p>

      <p>“A-Yao, what's wrong? Do you have a headache? Let me play you some music!!!” Lan Xichen frantically spins around and pats his pockets. After patting the entire length of his body, he lets out a dramatic gasp. “<em>Eh? </em>Where's my flute? Where did my flute go?”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao sighs, letting his face fall into his palm. “Xichen-ge, you didn't bring it with you...”</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen doesn't listen to him. He runs to Nie Mingjue and shakes his shoulders. “Da-ge!!! <em>Da-ge!!! </em>Have you seen my flute? I need my flute to play music for A-Yao!!!”</p>

      <p>Normally, the chief officer would yell at anyone who dares shake him like that. As luck would have it, Nie Mingjue throws his head back and lets out the loudest laugh Wei Ying has ever heard in his life. </p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue ruffles Meng Yao's hair. “He doesn't need music! Just give him some wine!”</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen happily nods. “That's a great idea!!!” He skips over to the nearest waitress, grabbing a glass of wine from her tray. “A-Yao!!! <em>A-Yao!!!</em>”</p>

      <p>'Dead inside' doesn't even cover what Meng Yao looks like right now. He takes the drink from Lan Xichen and knocks his head back, downing the entire glass in one gulp. Wei Ying blinks, unable to hide the surprise from his face. Even he will admit that's impressive.</p>

      <p>“Where's Jiang Cheng?” he asks. <em>And why has he let Xichen-ge drink alcohol?</em></p>

      <p>“He ran off,” Meng Yao answers. “Probably hiding.”</p>

      <p>Well... One look at Lan Xichen and it's easy to understand <em>why </em>Jiang Cheng isn't anywhere in sight. At the moment, Lan Xichen is going around asking everyone if they've seen his flute.</p>

      <p>Out of nowhere, someone smacks him on his back. It's so sudden that Wei Ying staggers forward, coughing. Before he can look up, Nie Mingjue is pushing a pint of beer in his face. “Wei Ying! Have a drink with me and Xichen! Where's Wangji?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying rubs his shoulder, grimacing at the ache spreading through his body. Is Nie Mingjue also drunk? That would explain why he's so happy for once then... <em>What a mess...</em></p>

      <p>“He went to find his uncle...” Wei Ying mumbles. He slowly pushes the pint away from him. “And, uh, no thanks.”</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen appears in front of him, grabbing the pint of beer. In the blink of an eye, he's downed the whole drink and Wei Ying can see the making of an apocalypse about to dawn on them. A drunk Lan is a very dangerous thing indeed. Speaking of which, where's Lan Zhan?</p>

      <p>“How did this even happen?” Wei Ying asks. He could have sworn that Lan Xichen was sober a few minutes ago!</p>

      <p><em>Not that it takes long to get a Lan drunk. </em>He'll never forget that terrifying day when he managed to get both Lan brothers drunk with the weakest bottle of wine made in history.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao helplessly rubs his forehead. “They're offering free drinks around. Xichen-ge accidentally drank one, and then Chief Nie took that as a sign to get drunk as well.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying scans the room. It's as he said; there's countless waitresses walking around, offering drinks to the guests. He didn't think much of it earlier, but now...</p>

      <p>His stomach churns as soon as he spots Lan Zhan at the other side of the room. There's a waitress right in front of him, smiling as she politely shows the tray of drinks.</p>

      <p><em>No... </em>Surely Lan Zhan wouldn't get one? Lan Zhan is sensible; he should <em>know </em>that's alcohol.</p>

      <p><em>Right?</em></p>

      <p>Lan Zhan reaches for a glass.</p>

      <p><em>Oh, shit.</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying breaks off into a run. “Lan Zhan, <em>wait— </em>fuck.”</p>

      <p>Too late. Lan Zhan takes a sip. Wei Ying slows down to a stop, groaning. Great. <em>Perfect. </em>Not only is Lan Xichen drunk, but now Lan Zhan is <em>also </em>drunk.</p>

      <p>Just like last time, Lan Zhan wobbles and falls face first onto the floor.</p>

      <p>“<em>Oh my god!” </em>the waitress shrieks at the top of her lungs. “I-Is he okay?! Someone get a doctor!”</p>

      <p>“It's okay, it's okay,” Wei Ying reassures her. Aside from the fact she's now unleashed a danger to society, everything is absolutely, one-hundred percent <em>okay.</em></p>

      <p>The waitress is frantically looking between him and Lan Zhan, hugging her tray of drinks to her chest. “But... But—”</p>

      <p>“It's fine. This happens all the time,” Wei Ying says. “I'll take care of him.”</p>

      <p>That reassures her. With a shaky nod, she scurries away, no doubt relieved that she doesn't have to be responsible for this.</p>

      <p>“<em>Dad?” </em>Sizhui runs over to them, gasping. “Oh no, Teacher Wei, what do we do?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying can only sigh. He squats down, poking Lan Zhan's cheeks. As expected, he's out cold.</p>

      <p>“You've never seen your dad drunk?”</p>

      <p>“I have! That's <em>exactly </em>why I'm worried!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying chuckles. Good to know he's not the only one who's been exposed to Lan Zhan's... <em>extraordinary </em>drunken behaviour.</p>

      <p>Maybe they can bring Lan Zhan to a room that's more private, at least until he wakes up again... Wei Ying looks around him, searching for an exit. As pretty as this room is, it's hard to see anything when the only source of light are the red lanterns above them.</p>

      <p>He can't find an exit, but he does manage to find Jin Ling standing by himself.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling doesn't notice him. He's too busy twiddling his thumbs and staring at Sizhui.</p>

      <p>Resisting the urge to smile, Wei Ying bites his lips. He averts his eyes back to Sizhui and pats his head. “Don't worry about it. I'll take care of Lan Zhan. You go enjoy yourself.” He nods, motioning over Sizhui's shoulder. “I think my nephew wants your attention.”</p>

      <p>Even in the near darkness, Wei Ying doesn't miss the blush quickly spreading through the teenager's cheeks. He ducks his head down in a vain attempt to hide it. “T-Teacher Wei...”</p>

      <p><em>“Go,” </em>Wei Ying urges.</p>

      <p>Sizhui spares one more glance at his unconscious dad before nodding.</p>

      <p><em>How cute, </em>Wei Ying thinks. He stands back up, watching in amusement as both teenagers shyly smile at each other. Jin Ling musters enough courage to grab Sizhui's hand, dragging him to the dance floor. Wei Ying mentally cheers him on. Good to see that Jin Ling hasn't grown up to be <em>as much </em>of a mess when it comes to flirting as his dad.</p>

      <p>When Wei Ying was that age, he was pestering Lan Zhan and showing him porn books. Those were the good, old times. Lan Zhan was so cute back when they were only fifteen...</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sighs to himself, smiling at the memories. He turns back to Lan Zhan... who is not on the floor.</p>

      <p>In fact, he's nowhere to be seen at all.</p>

      <p>“Lan... Lan Zhan?” Wei Ying spins around, scanning the room for a drunk, tall man wearing a white suit. Lan Xichen is there in the distance, dragging a suffering Meng Yao with him while Nie Mingjue follows, still laughing away.</p>

      <p>But no Lan Zhan!</p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>Where did he go? More importantly, <em>why </em>did he go? Wei Ying only took his eyes off him for a few seconds and suddenly he's gone!</p>

      <p>This is bad. This is really bad. Last time Lan Zhan was drunk, he vandalised a brick wall and almost killed Jiang Cheng with a shoe. Who knows what sort of crazy things he'll do in this party?</p>

      <p><em>No. </em>For the sake of everyone's sanity, Wei Ying <em>has </em>to find Lan Zhan. The fate of the world (and Jiejie's wedding!) depends on it.</p>

      <p>Resigned to this heavy responsibility, Wei Ying sprints around the room in search of his boyfriend. It doesn't take him long to find Mo Xuanyu again, still drunk off his head. Wen Qing is laughing at something he's said, but thankfully she's sober enough to notice Wei Ying running towards them.</p>

      <p>“What's wrong?” she asks.</p>

      <p>“Have you seen Lan Zhan?”</p>

      <p>“No, I thought you said—”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying doesn't wait for her to finish her sentence. He runs off again, cursing this turn of events. If he was a drunk Lan, what would he do...? More importantly, if he was a drunk Lan Zhan, <em>where </em>would he go?</p>

      <p>Asking that question to himself doesn't help at all. Wei Ying has no idea what a drunk Lan Zhan would do. The terrifying thing about him is that he's so unpredictable; Wei Ying wouldn't be surprised if he's already left the venue by now, terrorising the streets of Vegas.</p>

      <p>God, he really hopes that's not the case. If Lan Zhan decides to write <strong>LAN WANGJI OF GUSU WAS HERE</strong> all over a street in Vegas, then Wei Ying doesn't know if he'll cry or laugh over that.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, he'll find him before that ever happens.</p>

      <p>As Wei Ying rounds a corner, he runs face first into a wall.</p>

      <p><em>“Ow! Fuck!”</em></p>

      <p>Or not a wall. A wall wouldn't say that. A wall wouldn't say <em>anything.</em></p>

      <p>Staggering back, Wei Ying rubs his nose. “Jiang Cheng!”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng grabs him by the shoulder, shoving him behind the corner. <em>“Ssshhh!”</em></p>

      <p>“What are you—”</p>

      <p>“Shut the <em>fuck </em>up!”</p>

      <p>As if his life depends on it, Jiang Cheng squashes himself besides Wei Ying. Not even five seconds after, Wei Ying hears the sound of frantic footsteps passing them.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng!!! <em>A-Cheng!!! </em>Where are you? Where are <em>youuuuuu!!!”</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng physically shudders. Wei Ying covers his mouth, muffling the laugh that escapes him. Lan Xichen disappears back into the crowd, although his voice can still be heard even above all the music and drunken chatter.</p>

      <p>“Hiding from your own boyfriend?” Wei Ying says as soon as he's sure the older man can't hear them. “That's mean.”</p>

      <p>Groaning, Jiang Cheng leans his head against the wall. “Who the <em>fuck </em>gave him alcohol? I just went to the bathroom and I come back to <em>that! </em>” He throws his hands in the air and then faces to Wei Ying with a defeated sigh. “Where's Lan Wangji?”</p>

      <p>“Drunk. I'm trying to find him.”</p>

      <p>“<em>Ugh. </em>I should have known this would happen.”</p>

      <p>He's right. Of course an after-party would involve alcohol, and of course any Lan that even <em>breathes </em>in the same vicinity as alcohol would not be a good result. Still, Lan Zhan is normally so calm and serious that Wei Ying's brain must have erased the memory of his drunken endeavours. It really didn't cross his mind that this would happen!</p>

      <p>They walk out from behind the wall. Wei Ying still can't see Lan Zhan anywhere, although he does spot a young man approaching them.</p>

      <p>“Oh, Jiang Cheng. Hey.”</p>

      <p>The young man has a mop of dark hair and a serious look on his face, even when he's offering a somewhat awkward smile at Jiang Cheng. At his side is another man wearing thick-framed glasses. He's very slender, with skin as pale as snow, but a smile warmer than the sun.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng nods at the one who called out to him. “You came.”</p>

      <p>Curious, Wei Ying joins them.</p>

      <p>“Song Lan,” Jiang Cheng tells him, already guessing his silent questions. “He's a friend from work. Song Lan, this is my brother, Wei Ying.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying smiles at Song Lan. “I didn't know Jiang Cheng had friends.”</p>

      <p>That earns him a smack on the head.</p>

      <p>“I hope you don't mind that I brought Xingchen and A-Qing along, by the way,” Song Lan says. He motions towards the other guy beside him and a teenage girl who's sitting a few tables away from them, sipping on a can of Coke. She looks like she's around the same age as Sizhui, though Wei Ying's never seen her around school before. Maybe she goes to a different school?</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng shrugs. “Jin Zixuan told us to invite as many people as possible, so it's no problem at all.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan's crazy idea to invite half the population of Gusu was no problem at all, yeah—until a drunk Lan Zhan is among that population and Wei Ying can't find him anywhere. He ignores the rest of Jiang Cheng's conversation with his colleague, scanning the room once more in a desperate attempt to locate his boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Maybe he should call Lan Zhan? Then again, Lan Zhan usually keeps his phone on silent—and even if he didn't, would he pick it up now that he's drunk?</p>

      <p>Desperate, Wei Ying tries to call him several times. As he expected, Lan Zhan doesn't pick up at all.</p>

      <p>Fuck. Where could he have gone—</p>

      <p><em>“JIANG CHENG!”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying jumps out of the way in time. Nie Mingjue barrels past him, trapping Jiang Cheng into a headlock.</p>

      <p>“There you are! Have a drink with me!”</p>

      <p>Amused and slightly worried, Wei Ying witnesses Jiang Cheng's face slowly turn into a shade of a grape. He pats at Nie Mingjue's arms, wheezing for breath.</p>

      <p>“C-Chief—Nie!” he struggles. “L-Let go!”</p>

      <p>Just as he decides that he should probably save Jiang Cheng from being crushed to death by Nie Mingjue's impressive biceps, someone clings onto his arm and... starts crying?</p>

      <p>Confused, Wei Ying turns around. Huaisang's face is red with tears and he uses Wei Ying's tie to wipe his cheeks dry. Thankfully, Wei Ying stops him in time before he tries to use it to wipe his nose as well.</p>

      <p>“Wei <em>Ying!</em>” Huaisang bawls. He lets out another dramatic sob and wraps his arms around Wei Ying's neck, weeping into his chest.</p>

      <p>“W-Why... are you crying?” Wei Ying asks. He awkwardly pats Huaisang's back and prays to the heavens that he hasn't got snot all over his chest now.</p>

      <p><em>“I don't know!”</em></p>

      <p>Is <em>everyone </em>in this party drunk? Huaisang continues to sob against Wei Ying like his life has fallen apart. By this point, Wei Ying is too confused to try and pull him away. He sees Meng Yao slowly walk towards them, squinting at the Nie brothers. With another tired sigh, he grabs a drink from a nearby waitress.</p>

      <p>Huaisang's head perks up. He jumps to Meng Yao's side and snatches the drink away from him.</p>

      <p>“One more, Da-ge! One more!”</p>

      <p>Finally, Nie Mingjue drops Jiang Cheng and faces his younger brother with an unimpressed frown.</p>

      <p>“Haven't you drank enough?” he slurs.</p>

      <p>“<em>No! </em>Haven’t <em>you?</em>”</p>

      <p>Of course, as soon as Nie Mingjue hears this challenge, his jaw clenches and the determination in his eyes reminds Wei Ying of the time they announced the beginning of the Sunshot Campaign. With similar conviction, Nie Mingjue grasps another drink.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao sighs for the hundredth time tonight. Both Nie brothers chug back their drinks in record timing, spurred on by equally drunk cheers. Wei Ying feels like he's been thrown back to his university days. This is the sort of irresponsible behaviour you'd expect from students who are out getting drunk instead of studying for their final exams.</p>

      <p>In a turn of unexpected events, Huaisang finishes first. He jumps up and down, cheering. His victory lasts a total of seven seconds—and then he's off running to the nearest bathroom, most likely to empty the contents of his stomach.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng shakes his head to himself. “Someone should check if he's—”</p>

      <p>A garbled moan comes out of Nie Mingjue. He takes one step forward, and then passes out in a giant heap on the ground.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying looks down at the unconscious man. <em>Well. </em>That's not good.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng blinks, eyes wide. “Is he alive?” he says after some time.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao is the first to move. He calmly takes the last drink from the waitress and swirls the wine glass around with so much grace that you wouldn't think there was an unconscious man at his feet.</p>

      <p>He sips at the wine and lightly kicks Nie Mingjue's foot. Afterwards, a quiet groan responds from below.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately,” Meng Yao mutters, downing the rest of the glass.</p>

      <p>At the very least, Nie Mingjue is alive. Drunk off his head, yes, but alive. His drunken demise has gathered a crowd and it's not long until Jin Zixuan is running towards them. He slows down to a stop, wincing at the sight of the chief officer on the floor.</p>

      <p>“Is he okay?” he asks quietly.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shrugs. “I think so.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan massages his temples and closes his eyes. “Why is everyone already so drunk?”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao smirks. “Da-ge, you invited a bunch of lightweights.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan lets out something that's <em>probably </em>a laugh, but sounds more like a cry for help.</p>

      <p>“<em>There </em>you two are!”</p>

      <p>Jiejie's voice rings out from behind him. Wei Ying turns around in time, laughing as she hugs both Jiang Cheng and him into a vanilla-scented embrace. She's now changed into her second outfit; a form-fitting red dress that sparkles like a thousand rubies and garnets.</p>

      <p>“How are you both enjoying the party?”she asks.</p>

      <p>“It's, uh...” Jiang Cheng can't stop himself from staring at Nie Mingjue on the floor. “It's <em>something.”</em></p>

      <p>“Don't listen to him, Jiejie. He's just sulking because Xichen-ge ran off without him,” Wei Ying says. As usual, he ignores Jiang Cheng's scowl and laughs when Jiejie taps his nose.</p>

      <p>“I'm running <em>away </em>from him!” Jiang Cheng snaps.</p>

      <p>“Why? Where are Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen?” Jiejie looks around the room, eyes wide with curiosity. “I was hoping to talk to them.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head. “Not now. They're both drunk.”</p>

      <p>“Drunk?” She giggles. “I'd like to see that.”</p>

      <p>Patting her on the back, Jiang Cheng gently starts to lead her away from the crowd. “Trust me, A-Jie; you really don't—”</p>

      <p>He stops. Wei Ying stops. In fact, everyone stops.</p>

      <p>The music is cut off, replaced by the shrill noise of a flute. Slowly, one by one, everyone turns to the source of the sound.</p>

      <p>There, standing atop a table, is Lan Xichen enthusiastically playing a flute. He pays no attention to the staff members at his feet, asking him to get down before he hurts himself or damages any property.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying has no idea whether to laugh or not. To Lan Xichen's credit, he's very good at playing the flute, even if he is wasted.</p>

      <p>“Where did he get a flute from...” Meng Yao mumbles, genuinely confused.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng, on the other hand, has gone pale. “Oh god.”</p>

      <p>Jiejie covers her mouth. “Oh my.”</p>

      <p>The flute music halts. For a second, Wei Ying thinks that common sense has returned to Lan Xichen's head and he's gotten down the table.</p>

      <p>That, obviously, is not the case. Lan Xichen's eyes zero in on Jiang Cheng. One second he's standing on the table, and the next he's lunging across the room. Jiang Cheng doesn't even get to scream before he's tackled to the ground.</p>

      <p>“<em>Xichen! </em>Ow, my fucking head! <em>Why </em>are you always doing this—”</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen gasps, raising his head to look at Jiang Cheng with magnified concern. He seems to have no clue that he's lying on top of Jiang Cheng in front of hundreds of people.</p>

      <p>“You hit your head!!! <em>Oh no!!! </em>I'll kiss it better!!!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying feels an overwhelming wave of déjà vu as Lan Xichen grabs Jiang Cheng's face and kisses him for the entire room to see. It's classic entertainment at its best. Wei Ying would love to stay and tease Jiang Cheng about it, but he's also got his own drunk boyfriend—whose whereabouts are still unknown. Wei Ying needs to stop getting distracted. He should go look for Lan Zhan again—</p>

      <p><em>“WEI YING!”</em></p>

      <p>Oh shit. That's Lan Qiren's voice. Wei Ying shrinks into himself and slowly turns around. Sure enough, he comes face to face with the epitome of parental rage, in the form of Lan Qiren.</p>

      <p>“<em>You! </em>What's happened?!” Lan Qiren demands. “Why is Xichen drunk?! Where's Wangji?!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying wishes he could provide an answer, but it’s impossible. “I... have no idea...”</p>

      <p>That doesn't please the older man at all. Lan Qiren's face reddens until Wei Ying fears he'll literally qi deviate on the spot.</p>

      <p>Just then, Jingyi chooses this moment to join them. His bow tie is crooked and there’s a piece of rice stuck at his collar. He waves at Wei Ying, grinning wide.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Teacher Wei, have you seen Sizhui and Jin Ling... Oh, hey, Grandad.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi's presence is enough for Lan Qiren to forget the tirade of rants he was most likely going to unleash on Wei Ying. He directs his displeased scowl towards the young teenager instead, stroking his long beard.</p>

      <p>“I hope you're behaving yourself.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi stands up straighter. “I <em>am! </em>I promise I am!”</p>

      <p>At this, Lan Qiren says nothing and only juts his chin higher. He strokes his beard some more, narrowing his eyes at his grandson in scrutiny. Wei Ying contemplates sneaking away to search for Lan Zhan.</p>

      <p>A waitress pops out from nowhere, beaming at Lan Qiren. “Hello, would you like a drink?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyes widen. “Ah, that's—”</p>

      <p>Lan Qiren takes a sip and promptly collapses onto the floor.</p>

      <p>“...Alcohol.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sighs deeply and shakes his head at the waitress before she, too, can start freaking out. Honestly, can someone tell these waitresses to stop offering drinks to everyone? Or at least <em>don't </em>do it to the Lans!</p>

      <p>After a few seconds, Lan Qiren calmly gets up onto his feet and tidies his clothes like nothing has happened. He stands with grace and dignity. </p>

      <p>“Grandad, are you okay...?” Jingyi asks. “Did you hurt yourself?”</p>

      <p>Lan Qiren resumes stroking his beard. “Of course I am. What was it you were telling me before?”</p>

      <p>Well, he <em>looks </em>okay. Aside from the fact he just fainted for a few seconds, he seems like he's completely sober... Maybe the fainting is only a strange genetic effect?</p>

      <p>Jingyi scratches his head, exchanging confused glances with Wei Ying. “I... Nothing... I was just telling you that I was behaving myself...”</p>

      <p>A smile spreads across Lan Qiren's face. He nods. “Of course you are. I know you are.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi blinks. “What?”</p>

      <p>Lan Qiren reaches down to pat the teenager's head. “You're such well-behaved grandson; never getting into trouble, and always taking his studies seriously. A true Lan.”</p>

      <p>Poor Jingyi has never looked so lost in his entire life. His mouth opens and closes like a goldfish, struggling to find any words to say. “I... I am?”</p>

      <p>He's not the only one who's confused. Wei Ying is still having difficulty letting the scene sink in when Lan Qiren faces him with the friendliest smile he's ever seen.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying. I hope you're enjoying this party.” Lan Qiren pats his shoulder, unaware that Wei Ying's brain freezes at this unexpected gesture. “I'm very happy that you and Wangji have found each other. You are such a good influence on him.”</p>

      <p><em>He's drunk, </em>Wei Ying's head concludes. <em>This is him being drunk.</em></p>

      <p>He bites the inside of his cheek and swallows down a laugh. “Thank... you. I'm glad you think that.”</p>

      <p>Lan Qiren spares one more smile and then walks away. Wei Ying doesn't know how long he spends staring after the old man. The cogs of his brain are struggling to work again, too shocked after having witnessed a friendly Lan Qiren. A <em>drunk </em>Lan Qiren of all things. That's something you see once in a lifetime.</p>

      <p>God, what else is going to happen in this party?</p>

      <p>In perfect timing, the doors burst open. Wei Ying looks up in time to see a figure in white back-flipping into the room.</p>

      <p>He screams.</p>

      <p>Pandemonium ensues.</p>

      <p>Within the space of a few seconds, there are staff workers flooding into the room, running after the figure in white. Wei Ying staggers back. That guy in white... <em>For goodness sake... That's Lan Zhan.</em></p>

      <p>He stands on the spot, too shocked to move a single muscle. Around him, people are gasping and pointing. Lan Zhan skids to a halt in front of him. His face is devoid of emotion as always and his eyes are fixed on Wei Ying. To anyone, this would look completely normal, if it weren't for the fact that Lan Zhan just back-flipped into the room, carrying a whole roast chicken under his arm.</p>

      <p>“Stop him!” one of the workers shriek. Looking at his uniform, Wei Ying would guess that he's a cook... That means that all of these staff workers have came from the kitchen...</p>

      <p><em>Did Lan Zhan break into the kitchen to steal a chicken?</em></p>

      <p>“Wei Ying,” Lan Zhan calls.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyes widen at the large chicken he's holding. “Lan Zhan... What... What have you <em>done?”</em></p>

      <p>A lot of strange things have happened in his life. Wei Ying thought he's seen it all, but... When Lan Zhan slowly descends onto one knee and holds out the chicken in front of him, Wei Ying has to stand back, covering his mouth.</p>

      <p>A gasp comes from the crowd gathering around them.</p>

      <p>“Oh my god,” Mo Xuanyu cries. “He's <em>proposing!”</em></p>

      <p>As if everything isn't crazy enough, Lan Xichen chooses that moment to clamber on top of a table again, raising his flute to his lips.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying listens to the wild notes of the flute filling the room, all the while staring into the chicken Lan Zhan is holding out in front of him. Is he dreaming? <em>Is he high? Is this seriously happening?</em></p>

      <p>“What is going on here?”</p>

      <p>Everyone looks up. A tall man has rushed into the room, wearing a dark crimson suit and... an eyepatch?</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan steps out from the crowd. “Hua Cheng! I'm sorry about this. I didn't expect everyone to get so...” He looks around the room, wincing at the mess. “Drunk.”</p>

      <p><em>Wait. </em>That pirate-looking guy is the <em>owner?</em> He's the 'Demon King'? There's nothing demonic about him! Wei Ying was expecting a seven-foot guy with an eight pack and a few scars on his face, not a lanky man with an eyepatch!</p>

      <p>“Get him down from the table!” someone yells, pointing at Lan Xichen.</p>

      <p>Sensing danger, Lan Xichen jumps down. He sprints to Jiang Cheng's side. Everything happens so fast that all Wei Ying can do is watch as Jiang Cheng is tossed over Lan Xichen's shoulder, yelling out a string of curses and swear words. Before anyone can stop him, or even think about what on earth is happening, Lan Xichen escapes out of the room.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying has given up trying to make sense of this situation. He clutches his stomach and starts laughing. He laughs until his cheeks hurt, and until he sees Lan Zhan rising on his feet. The drunk man glares at everyone around them with a frost of winter in his gold eyes.</p>

      <p>Then, he's grabbing Wei Ying's hand and dragging him out of the room. Behind them, Wei Ying hears the kitchen staff yelling, demanding that Lan Zhan comes back.</p>

      <p>This is literally the craziest thing Wei Ying's ever witnessed in his entire life. Throwing his head back, he laughs louder than he's ever laughed and runs alongside Lan Zhan's side, escaping into the night.</p>

      <p>I'm so sorry for the mess that is this chapter but this is what happens when you give the Lans alcohol I guess... Also that backflipping LWJ is soooo not a reference to that iconic CQL scene where he backflips outta nowhere just to save WWX. I really just wanted a chapter for everyone to interact and be <strike>drunk</strike> happy, so you get this mess.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Mina who drew that Instagram selfie for me!!</p>
