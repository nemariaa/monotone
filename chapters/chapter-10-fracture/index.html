      <p>Wei Ying does not stir. Before he succumbs to his dreams, he feels the slight tightening of arms around him, the light brush of lips against his forehead. There's nothing but pounding in his head, but he leans closer to the warmth. He needs to sleep, he <em>wants</em> to sleep, and the gentle lull of Lan Zhan's breathing is slowly, but surely, pulling him into the void.</p>
      
      <p>He sighs. Even amidst the mess of his thoughts, he recalls this is the first time in a while he hasn't slept alone. It isn't so bad. Part of him clings onto whatever consciousness he can just to savour the warmth, the company. It <em>really</em> isn't so bad. He moves even closer and finally, finally allows himself to fall asleep.</p>
      
      <p>The smell of sandalwood guides him in the night, taking him back to years he has been running away from for so long.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>His real parents are nothing but empty memories to him. They were happy and kind, Wei Ying knows that much, but the only clear memory he has left is when he lost them.</p>
      
      <p>It was evening, maybe almost midnight. Wei Ying was six, reluctant to go to sleep even after his father read several fairy tales to him before bed. His parents loved to tell him all sorts of stories, be it fictional or little tales from their travels. Wei Ying would sit on his bed, wide-eyed, too excited after hearing about the adventures his mother and father once had. He never knew if they were real or his parents were just lying, but he didn't care. He was only a child, and his parents were exciting; the main characters in all the stories he knew.</p>
      
      <p>“One more story!” he'd say, and his father would laugh while his mother promised he could have more tomorrow evening instead.</p>
      
      <p>Except he didn't.</p>
      
      <p>He was shaken awake by his father, so sudden Wei Ying can still remember the fright of being pulled away from peaceful sleep. His fears multiplied as he saw his parents' faces. He had only ever seen them smiling. Wei Ying did not know why they were so scared. They were heroes in their stories; why would they be scared of anything?</p>
      
      <p>His father carried him into his arms, breathing hard. He opened their wardrobe and pushed Wei Ying's small body into the depths of their coats and clothes. Wei Ying whined, reaching for his parents but his mother shushed him, stroking his hair.</p>
      
      <p>“Stay here, A-Ying,” his father said. “Whatever happens, <em>stay here</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>Why were they shaking? What was wrong?</p>
      
      <p>“We love you, A-Ying,” his mother said. She kissed him one last time before prying his small hands away from her. “We love you so much.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying didn't know why, but he wanted to cry. His bottom lip trembled and tears blurred his vision. He didn't want to stay in this wardrobe, he wanted to follow his parents. He was scared they would go on adventures without him, that they would leave him all alone in this darkness.</p>
      
      <p>His father cupped his face, squeezing his cheeks slightly. “Hey, don't cry. Give us a smile, come on.”</p>
      
      <p>He frantically rubbed his eyes, wiping any traces of tears away. It didn't feel right to smile, but if his parents wanted him to do it then Wei Ying would listen. He looked up at them and gave them the biggest grin he could, wishing it would get rid of the sadness in their own eyes.</p>
      
      <p>“Good boy,” his mother whispered. “Never ever let anyone get rid of your smile.”</p>
      
      <p>There was a bang on the door. Wei Ying jumped, the smile on his face erased within seconds. He turned to his parents and only saw the wardrobe's doors closing in on him.</p>
      
      <p>Then, darkness.</p>
      
      <p>He heard muffled voices, deep, gruff, and unknown. There was a crack in the wardrobe he could peak through. The figures he made out were dressed in black, their faces obscured. Below them were two dogs sniffing at the floor, growling.</p>
      
      <p>He was scared. These people sounded a lot like any villain from the stories his parents told him, but why were they here? Could his parents get rid of them?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying wanted nothing more than to jump out and hug his mom and dad. The only thing stopping him was his dad's voice telling him to stay in this wardrobe, no matter what happened. How long was that supposed to be? What did these people want?</p>
      
      <p>He peaked into the crack again, just in time to see a large man raise a knife at his father. Wei Ying's eyes widened, looking away.</p>
      
      <p>And then, the screaming began. Wei Ying covered his mouth and squeezed his eyes shut, desperate to muffle out the sounds of his own sobs and whimpers. This shouldn't be happening. He was scared! He wanted his mom and his dad, but all he could hear were their screams over the sounds of struggling, furniture breaking and smashing. It felt like it would never end.</p>
      
      <p>As silence finally fell, the only thing left Wei Ying could hear were the dogs. They were still growling, closer and closer.</p>
      
      <p>One of them began to nudge the wardrobe door with its nose.</p>
      
      <p>Shaking, Wei Ying buried himself deeper into the coats around him. He could smell the perfume his mother always wore here. He wished he could hug her right now.</p>
      
      <p>“Hey, there's someone else here.”</p>
      
      <p>The dogs were growling much louder. Footsteps neared the wardrobe, and the six year old child could do nothing but squeeze his hands tighter around his mouth and nose, holding his breath. He shouldn't make a noise. He didn't know why, but these people were bad. He couldn't let them find him.</p>
      
      <p>“Leave it. We were told to keep the kid alive, remember?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don't see the point of that. Why does he want to keep a kid alive?”</p>
      
      <p>“Does it matter? Just do your job. Let's go.”</p>
      
      <p>The footsteps trailed off. Before Wei Ying could sigh in relief, the dogs barked again. They lunged at the wardrobe, shaking it. He whimpered and shuffled deeper into the darkness—not before he caught a glimpse outside through the crack.</p>
      
      <p><em>Blood.</em> There was so much blood. On the floor, his parents lay face down in a red puddle. They weren't moving.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying almost screamed. The view of his parents was replaced by a set of snarling, pointed teeth, snapping and barking at him. He covered his eyes and scrambled away, squeezing himself against the dark corners of the wardrobe.</p>
      
      <p>“These fucking dogs. Come <em>here</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>There was muffled scrambling. The dogs seemed to whine, and after an eternity, they stopped pawing at the wardrobe and left it alone. Wei Ying still did not breathe, even when the footsteps trailed off and their house was filled with silence.</p>
      
      <p><em>Whatever happens, stay here.</em></p>
      
      <p>He stayed, huddled in the cramped space, crying into his hands. No matter how much he cried, he couldn't get rid of the image of his parents there on that floor, bleeding. He couldn't stop hearing their screams, the loud growls of those dogs—those <em>monsters</em>. He didn't know how long he stayed there, but he cried enough that his eyes stung and his tears were no more.</p>
      
      <p>When the wardrobe door opened, Wei Ying thought he would cry all over again.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying. It's me,” a voice said. It was soft and gentle, a bit like his dad's, but it wasn't his dad at all. “Don't worry, you're safe now. I won't let anyone hurt you.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying allowed himself to be carried out of the wardrobe. He clung onto the tall figure, sobbing into his shoulder. His parents were no longer on the floor although the stain of blood was still there. The room was thrashed, hardly looking like the place his dad would tell stories in.</p>
      
      <p>“I want my mom and dad,” Wei Ying mumbled, turning to the man who was carrying him.</p>
      
      <p>Indigo eyes were staring back. The man had black hair that almost reached down to his shoulders and a softness about him that would make anyone feel at ease. Wei Ying recognised him: <em>Uncle Jiang.</em> He was his dad's best friend and he would often visit them on weekends to talk to his parents. Sometimes, he gave Wei Ying sweets or little toys, and the child grew to anticipate his visits solely because of this. Wei Ying liked him a lot, but he still wanted his dad more.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm sorry, A-Ying,” Uncle Jiang said, wiping the tears away from Wei Ying's cheeks.</p>
      
      <p>Maybe, at that age, Wei Ying already knew what had happened. He couldn't understand why it had to happen, only that it did. There were bad people out there and they decided to take his parents away from him. He bit his trembling lip and remembered what his mother said.</p>
      
      <p><em>Never ever let anyone get rid of your smile.</em></p>
      
      <p>And so, he took a deep breath and gave Uncle Jiang the biggest smile he could muster.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang's house was much bigger than Wei Ying expected. It was clean and tidy, nothing like the comfortable mess his family lived in. His parents never cared for making their house look nice yet it was enough for the Wei family. It was home.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying looked around the large rooms. His mother's little ornaments and stuffed toys were nowhere in sight, and neither were his dad's sketchbooks. He couldn't see the family portraits they hung on the wall, lopsided and crooked, with his parents laughing at a silly expression Wei Ying was making for the camera. There were no pictures here, or ornaments, or anything to tell Wei Ying this place was anything like a home at all.</p>
      
      <p>He suddenly felt very lost. He clung tighter onto Uncle Jiang's hand and chewed his bottom lip. His mother wouldn't want him to start crying again.</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang led him to a room with two women inside. One of them couldn't have looked much older than him; maybe nine or ten years old. She greeted Wei Ying with a friendly smile that eased his worries a bit. That was soon gone by the time he turned to the other woman.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying guessed she was Uncle Jiang's wife. Her long black hair was loose, trailing down to her waist, and her eyes were outlined with dark make-up that made them stand out more. She was very pretty, though the way she glared at Wei Ying made the young child look away in an instant.</p>
      
      <p>“What's going on?” she asked.</p>
      
      <p>“This is Wei Changze's son,” Uncle Jiang said. He laid a hand on Wei Ying's shoulder as the child continued to cling onto him. “I'll be taking care of him from now on.”</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang's wife continued to stare at Wei Ying. He fiddled under her gaze, wondering what he had done wrong for her to be like this. Was it because he looked dirty? Or he hadn't taken his shoes off before entering the house? He had been too busy looking at the house to remember taking his shoes off... He vaguely remembered his mother telling him it was rude if he ever did this.</p>
      
      <p>“And it didn't occur to you that you should have discussed this with me before?” she said.</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang gave a sigh. “Dear, he has nowhere to go. I can't just leave him.”</p>
      
      <p>A bitter laugh came from the woman. Wei Ying found himself hiding behind Uncle Jiang again, not wanting to anger his wife more. He had only been here for less than ten minutes and he'd already done something wrong.</p>
      
      <p>“He looks exactly like her,” Uncle Jiang's wife said. The scowl on her face was gone, though Wei Ying still couldn't return her gaze.</p>
      
      <p>In the end, she shook her head and turned away. “Do what you like,” she said, and left the room.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying heard another soft sigh coming from Uncle Jiang. He said nothing, stroking Wei Ying's back before smiling up at the younger girl.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Li, this is Wei Ying,” he said. “I've told you about him before.”</p>
      
      <p>The girl nodded, joining them. Her smile was bright and lovely, the complete opposite of her mother. It was impossible not to return it.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm Jiang Yanli,” she said. “Nice to meet you.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shook her hand, revelling at how warm it was. Her hair was tied up into two braids and her eyes held a maturity in them that was much older than her age.</p>
      
      <p>“Where's A-Cheng?” Uncle Jiang asked, looking around.</p>
      
      <p>As if right on cue, footsteps sounded from the other side of the room. Wei Ying looked up and saw a boy of his age running towards them. He stood up straighter, glad there was also another kid here he could be friends with—and then immediately froze when he saw what followed him.</p>
      
      <p>Three dogs. Three dogs!</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying yelped, throwing himself onto Uncle Jiang. He cried, shaking and trembling, remembering the horrible growls those dogs were making last night. Because the animals were there when his parents were hurt, the young child was convinced it had been their fault. They had taken his family away from him—they would try and hurt him next! Wei Ying sobbed and sobbed until Uncle Jiang picked him up, running a hand through his tangled hair.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying, A-Ying, it's okay. They won't hurt you,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>All Wei Ying could hear were the barks the dogs were making. They were only small puppies, resembling clouds rather than the large mongrels he saw through the wardrobe. Regardless, that did little to calm the child. He did not stop crying, burying his face into Uncle Jiang's shoulder.</p>
      
      <p>“No, no! Please get them away! They're scary!”</p>
      
      <p>For the rest of that day, Wei Ying did not let go of Uncle Jiang. He refused to be let down, wailing every time the puppies dared to enter the same room as him. Thankfully, Uncle Jiang never complained once. All he did was sigh and stroke Wei Ying's hair, reassuring the child that the animals would not hurt him. Even so, it was clear Wei Ying was not overcoming his fear of dogs so soon. Everything about them reminded Wei Ying of the night he lost his parents. No matter how much Uncle Jiang promised to protect him, it would not get rid of the awful memory of hiding in that wardrobe.</p>
      
      <p>After a few days, Uncle Jiang decided it would be best to give the puppies away to another family. His son was not happy, at all.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng used every opportunity to glare at Wei Ying, showing his dislike for him without any hesitation whatsoever. He made Aunt Yu look friendly at that point, which was saying a lot considering Wei Ying knew just how much she did not like him either.</p>
      
      <p>“I want my puppies back!” Jiang Cheng would scream for hours. “Who cares if he's scared of them! Who cares about him!”</p>
      
      <p>It was a shame. Wei Ying had hoped to become friends with Jiang Cheng, especially as he got very lonely whenever Uncle Jiang had to go for work. As his uncle felt it would be better for him to adjust to his new home first, Wei Ying did not go to his new school yet. Jiejie was very friendly and kind, but Wei Ying did not want to bother her. Instead, he spent his days all alone in Uncle Jiang's room.</p>
      
      <p>For some reason, Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu did not sleep together in the same room during most nights. Because Jiang Cheng was still angry, Wei Ying stayed with Uncle Jiang, at least until his son calmed down. If such a thing was possible.</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang tried his best. He comforted and apologised to his son, telling him Wei Ying was terrified of dogs, that it could not be helped. However, Jiang Cheng was just as stubborn as his mother. He would only shake his head and stomp his feet, demanding he wanted his puppies back. Then, he'd glare at Wei Ying and blame everything on him until his father told him off. That silenced him, but it did not get rid of the scowl on his face. If anything, it made it worse.</p>
      
      <p>One day, Uncle Jiang came home carrying a large plushie. Wei Ying's gut lurched when he saw it looked exactly like a gigantic dog, but he managed to stop himself from freaking out once he realised it was only a toy. Still, it looked terrifying. He wrung his hands and stayed away, watching from the distance as Jiang Cheng's eyes lit up at the sight of it.</p>
      
      <p>“This is for you, A-Cheng,” Uncle Jiang said, kneeling down to give his son the oversized plushie.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying did not think he ever saw Jiang Cheng look so happy. He grabbed the plushie and hugged it, drowning in its fur.</p>
      
      <p>“Mine?” Jiang Cheng asked. His grin alone could rival the sun. “It's so fluffy!”</p>
      
      <p>Watching them, Wei Ying couldn't help but think of his own father. He shuffled his feet and looked down, remembering what his Mom said. Keep smiling... Don't be sad...</p>
      
      <p>With Jiang Cheng in a much better mood, Uncle Jiang thought that night would be a perfect opportunity for Wei Ying and him to start sharing a room. Wei Ying entered Jiang Cheng's bedroom with his own sheets and blanket, only to be met with a very unwelcoming glare from the other child.</p>
      
      <p>It was worse because Jiang Cheng was hugging the oversized plushie. It looked nothing like a real dog, yet it was still enough to make Wei Ying freeze on the spot. He wrapped his arms tighter around his sheets, stepping away until his back hit the wall behind him.</p>
      
      <p>“I don't want you here!” Jiang Cheng snapped. “I don't like you!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying flinched. “Uncle Jiang said I could sleep here too...”</p>
      
      <p>“He's <em>my</em> dad, not yours! And this is <em>my</em> room! Get out!”</p>
      
      <p>Clueless, Wei Ying remained where he was. Uncle Jiang looked so happy when he said Wei Ying could finally sleep in the same room as Jiang Cheng. He didn't want to disappoint him after everything he had done...</p>
      
      <p>“Uncle Jiang said we have to share rooms now...” Wei Ying mumbled, risking a glance at Jiang Cheng.</p>
      
      <p>As soon as he looked up, Jiang Cheng pushed him. He yelped, bringing up the sheets to block the other from doing it again.</p>
      
      <p>“Get! <em>Out!</em> If I ever see your face again, I'm going to get a big dog to bite you!”</p>
      
      <p>All Wei Ying heard was that a big dog was going to bite him. His eyes widened and he quickly dropped his sheets.</p>
      
      <p>“I-I'll go away!” he said, fumbling for the door. “Don't get the dogs!”</p>
      
      <p>He tripped out of the room and didn't look back. It was quite late in the evening and everyone was probably trying to sleep. Wei Ying didn't want to go back to Uncle Jiang's room in case Aunt Yu was there now that he was supposed to share with Jiang Cheng. He had already bothered the adults enough since living here. Not knowing where else to go, he scurried to the living room.</p>
      
      <p>All of a sudden, he heard loud barking. The noise was so loud that he tripped over his own feet, landing on the floor with a loud <em>thud</em>. To make things worse, the first thing he laid his eyes on when he got up again was a large dog on the TV screen.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying didn't even think twice. He covered his eyes and ran off, sobbing. In his head, the dogs were barking non-stop, growling as they neared him. They would bite him, eat him alive! All he could do was keep running, running as far as he could, until he stumbled out of Uncle Jiang's house and into the cold streets.</p>
      
      <p>He wanted to go home! Even if his parents weren't there anymore, Wei Ying missed his house and his toys and his own room. He was sure he could probably look after himself if he went back home... He used to watch his mom cook dinner—surely it wouldn't be so hard? If he tried extra, <em>extra</em> hard, he could copy her. Maybe, if he tried hard enough, he could get himself a job like his dad said adults had. He didn't need to bother Uncle Jiang at all, he could look after himself just fine!</p>
      
      <p>Inspired, the young child ran further down the streets. He didn't know where his house was, but he would find it eventually...</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying didn't know how long he was running for. He ran until he grew tired and the night got too cold. He left in such a rush that he didn't bother to bring a coat with him. He was still in his slippers!</p>
      
      <p>Panting, he stopped to take a few deep breaths. He was tired, cold, and sleepy. He wanted a nice, warm bed to sleep in but it only dawned on the young child he didn't have a home anymore. Not yet, anyway. He needed to keep on running... He couldn't stop here...</p>
      
      <p>He was just about to start running again when he heard it. <em>Barking.</em></p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying fell back, a scream lodged in his throat as he saw two dogs barking at him from behind this house's fence. All of the courage he built up in trying to be independent drained out of him. He sank to the floor, covering his ears, wishing his parents were here to save him from the bad monsters.</p>
      
      <p>“Shoo! Shoo! Go away!”</p>
      
      <p>Slowly, he looked up to see Jiang Cheng throwing a stick over the fence. The dogs scrambled away, yelping after the flying branch. Once they were gone, Jiang Cheng turned back to Wei Ying with a frown, folding his arms.</p>
      
      <p>“They're gone now...” he mumbled.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shook his head. “What... W-What if they come back?”</p>
      
      <p>“Then get up! Let's go away from here!”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng yanked Wei Ying to his feet, grumbling to himself. The memory of the dogs were still haunting him, filling his head with paranoia, therefore Wei Ying didn't hesitate to grab Jiang Cheng's hand. His eyes kept flickering to the fence, convinced the dogs would return, jump over and rip him to shreds.</p>
      
      <p>Rolling his eyes, Jiang Cheng tugged him closer. “What are you doing out here, running by yourself? You're so dumb!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying rubbed his eyes with his other hand, pouting. “You said... the dogs...”</p>
      
      <p>“I-I didn't mean it, okay!” Jiang Cheng groaned. He turned around and pulled Wei Ying along. “Let's just go home.”</p>
      
      <p>As long as they were getting away from the dogs, Wei Ying was not complaining. He hurried after Jiang Cheng, keeping their hands clasped together. His hand was sweaty and it only occurred to Wei Ying that Jiang Cheng was also slightly panting. Did he run after him?</p>
      
      <p>“Why are you so scared of dogs anyway?” Jiang Cheng asked after a while, looking at Wei Ying from the corner of his eyes.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying was glad Jiang Cheng was no longer glaring at him, although he didn't like where the conversation was heading. He couldn't stop the image of his parents laying lifeless on the floor, surrounded by a red puddle. Those horrible men... those dogs... Wei Ying shook his head and forced it out of his mind.</p>
      
      <p>“They hurt my parents... They're the reason why... why they're...”</p>
      
      <p>He trailed off. A week had now passed and he still didn't dare to utter <em>that</em> word out loud. He already knew his parents wouldn't be coming back, but he couldn't say that word. If he did, then... then he didn't know what he would do. He was scared he would start crying again. His mother wouldn't want him to be sad; he had to keep on smiling, no matter what.</p>
      
      <p>To his surprise, he felt Jiang Cheng squeezing his hand. Wei Ying turned to him, raising his eyebrows. The other child gave him a toothy grin, transforming the unfriendly expression on his face into something that made Wei Ying's chest blossom with a feeling he hadn't felt in a while. It was the same feeling he felt when Uncle Jiang found him. He was... he was glad.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, I'm going to scare away any dog that comes near you now then!” Jiang Cheng said. “You just have to stay by my side!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying found himself beaming back. “Okay!”</p>
      
      <p>Hand in hand, the two made their way back home, or at least they tried to. All the streets looked the same, and it didn't help Wei Ying did not pay attention to his surroundings when he ran off. He thought that Jiang Cheng would know the way back, but half an hour passed and Wei Ying was certain they'd seen the same tree for the third time.</p>
      
      <p>“Are we lost...?” he asked, trying not to sound worried.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng threw a scowl in his direction. “No, s-shut up! I know... I know the way home!”</p>
      
      <p>They carried on walking until they passed by that tree for the fourth time. Wei Ying's feet were beginning to ache. He could also tell Jiang Cheng's patience was running thin even if he refused to admit they really were lost.</p>
      
      <p>“You two! There you are!”</p>
      
      <p>The two of them froze, slowly turning to the source of the voice. It was like seeing an angel coming out of nowhere; Jiang Yanli emerged from the shadows, dressed in a large white coat. Within seconds, both boys clung to her, shivering.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Jie!” Jiang Cheng cried.</p>
      
      <p>She laughed at the two kids refusing to let her go. Although only nine years old, Wei Ying always got the feeling she acted much older than her age. Wei Ying hugged her tighter, burying his face into her fluffy sleeves.</p>
      
      <p>“Both of you are freezing! You'll get a cold out here!” she said, gathering both boys to huddle inside her coat.</p>
      
      <p>Although it was awkward to walk like this, Jiang Yanli held onto Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng, making sure they were always inside the coat with her. It did little to shield them from the cold and probably made things even worse; what mattered was that they were on their way home, guided by their older sister.</p>
      
      <p>As soon as they spotted their house, Wei Ying saw Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu waiting outside.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying! A-Cheng!” Uncle Jiang called, rushing to their side. “You're both safe! Where have you been?”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng fiddled with his sleeves. “It was my—”</p>
      
      <p>“It's my fault,” Wei Ying cut in. “I-I thought I heard a dog, so I ran away.... Jiang Cheng found me...”</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu scoffed. She had her arms folded, looking down at Wei Ying with no concern whatsoever. “I told you he would only cause trouble, making us worry like this.”</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang said nothing to her. He stroked back Wei Ying's hair and then did the same for Jiang Cheng. Just looking at how worried he seemed made Wei Ying feel bad. He didn't like burdening others, especially with how much Uncle Jiang had already done for him.</p>
      
      <p>“Please, both of you, don't run off in the middle of the night. What if something bad happened?”</p>
      
      <p>Looking down, both boys nodded. “Sorry...” they mumbled in unison.</p>
      
      <p>Luckily, that was that. Uncle Jiang pulled both of them into a hug afterwards, ushering them inside where it was warm.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying pretended not to notice the way Aunt Yu glared at him. She had not been the slightest bit worried about his safety. Would she have cared if he ran away and never came back? Probably not.</p>
      
      <p>For now, he did not let it bother him. He was happy enough having Jiang Cheng as a new friend.</p>
      
      <p>That night, both of them finally shared a room, with Jiang Cheng cuddling his large plushie and Wei Ying drooling onto his new sheets. It was not the home he longed for and missed, but it was something. He was lucky he had something to begin with.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>The years passed by and life was... life wasn't very exciting, to be honest. Wei Ying excelled in school without trying, and he made friends with even less effort. He was the type of person that slacked off with most things and yet still received results that people would work ages for. Some called him a prodigy, some called him lazy. Jiang Cheng called him an idiot.</p>
      
      <p>At the age of thirteen, Wei Ying wondered if his life would ever be like the stories his parents used to tell him. If he couldn't travel as much as they did, could he at least find the same happiness doing something else? For now, he was content, but content was <em>boring</em>. He wanted <em>more.</em></p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying, could you help me study for this test...? If I fail it again, my brother will kill me...”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying sighed. He definitely wanted more than having to act as Huaisang's tutor.</p>
      
      <p>Scratching his head, he leaned closer to take a look at the book the other teenager had been stressing about for the past hour. Beside them, Jiang Cheng was writing notes faster than the wind.</p>
      
      <p>“Eh, what test? I never study for anything.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng rolled his eyes. “When will you stop messing around?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying turned to him, grinning. “I still pass though, right?”</p>
      
      <p>Huaisang made a noise that resembled a crying whale. He faceplanted the desk, pushing his book away from him. Wei Ying was certain he hadn't even read three pages of that thing yet; all he had been doing for the past hour was complain about studying rather than doing it.</p>
      
      <p>Then again, Wei Ying never studied himself. His attention span was non-existent. If he needed to do any notes, he'd just copy Jiang Cheng's.</p>
      
      <p>Ever since they started school, Jiang Cheng and Wei Ying were inseparable. Whenever there was trouble, Wei Ying was there, and Jiang Cheng wasn't far behind to clean up his mess. Despite this, Wei Ying managed to get good grades, sometimes even top of the class. He'd be a perfect student if he learnt to shut his mouth, the teachers would say.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying, teach me how to get good grades... With Parents' Evening coming up, I'm scared I won't survive this time...” Huaisang whined, still embracing the desk.</p>
      
      <p>Nie Huaisang was just as lazy as Wei Ying, perhaps even lazier. Unfortunately for him, he lacked Wei Ying's natural ability to bullshit his way through life and therefore crashed down with grades that barely passed. Even <em>more</em> unfortunately for him, his brother would not accept anything lower than an A.</p>
      
      <p>“Is your brother really that scary...?” Wei Ying asked. He barely saw Nie Mingjue, but he knew he was seven years older than Huaisang. And that he was terrifying.</p>
      
      <p>“The other day, he threw my PlayStation 2 out the window because he saw I failed my Physics test.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying winced. “Ouch. Good luck then.”</p>
      
      <p>Parents' Evening for him wasn't a problem. Even if the teachers had complaints, all Uncle Jiang would do was smile at Wei Ying and pat his back. They were honest about his achievements and even more about his shortcomings, yet Uncle Jiang never paid attention to the negatives. No matter what trouble Wei Ying started, he had nothing but praise for him.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying, you're doing so well in school,” he said when they were back at home. Wei Ying was now far too old to be picked up, though that didn't stop Uncle Jiang from ruffling his hair with a doting smile. “I'm so proud of you.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying laughed, secretly loving the attention. Uncle Jiang had always been kind to him, and for that he was endlessly grateful.</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you, Uncle Jiang!” he said.</p>
      
      <p>“And what about your own son?”</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu's voice immediately made the smile on Wei Ying's face drop. His eyes flickered to Jiang Cheng, who was sitting on the other side of the room with his gaze fixed on the floor. Although he said nothing, Wei Ying could see the way his fists clenched, how his eyebrows furrowed at the mention of him.</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang sighed. “That goes without saying. Of course I'm proud of A-Cheng too.”</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu shook her head, sneering. “Really now? With how much you focus on that brat, you'd think <em>he</em> was your son instead!”</p>
      
      <p>They were always having fights like this. Not a day passed without them arguing with each other, filling the room with a thick tension that choked the children until tomorrow came and repeated the cycle, over and over again. Wei Ying should have been used to it, but he couldn't brush them off—not when he felt he was the reason the two adults could not see eye to eye.</p>
      
      <p>He knew Aunt Yu didn't like him, at all. He knew she would never see him as a son, and he would never see her as a mother. They were not family; they simply lived under the same house and rarely spoke a word to each other. As much as he wanted her approval, she would always see something in him that she despised.</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang rose. The softness in his eyes were gone, replaced with a stern disapproval that only appeared whenever he defended Wei Ying. It made Aunt Yu glare even more.</p>
      
      <p>“Dear, please. Not now,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>He always called her that; <em>Dear</em>. His parents used to call each other names too, like <em>love</em> and <em>darling</em>, but those felt like they were filled with adoration. Wei Ying would listen to them talking to each other and hope he would find love like that one day. When Wei Ying listened to Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu, all he felt was a need to leave the room. He could not stand to be there when they were together. It was suffocating. He didn't know how they could live like this.</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu shook her head, sneering. She was a beautiful woman who didn't look like she ever aged. Yet, in all the years Wei Ying lived with the Jiangs, he had never seen her smile. Not once.</p>
      
      <p>She took one last glance at Wei Ying, as if to say this was all his fault, and then left the room. Even when she was gone, the tension remained. Wei Ying stayed silent. Uncle Jiang looked more tired. Jiang Cheng, who was still sitting all alone on the couch, only clenched his fists tighter, shrinking into himself.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>If you were to ask other people who they preferred out of the two, they would most likely choose Wei Ying rather than Jiang Cheng. Although he could be annoying, Wei Ying was easy and pleasant to talk to. Meanwhile, Jiang Cheng was almost a copy of his mother; his temper was uncontrollable and unpredictable, and his remarks were blunt, often insulting. He didn't bother to sugar-coat his words like his father did; rather, he thought it was best to tell the truth and go.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying often joked around that Jiang Cheng would never get more friends if he continued to act like this. They were fifteen now, and they were still joint at the hip in school. Jiang Cheng didn't care for popularity, and neither did Wei Ying although it came naturally for others to love him. They stuck together, not because they were brothers, but because they were most comfortable with each other's presence. Jiang Cheng could reign in Wei Ying's habit for finding trouble, and Wei Ying was one of the rare people who could bring a smile to his anti-social brother's face. They were complete opposites, but they were best together. They <em>never</em> separated.</p>
      
      <p>If there was one thing they united in, it was to protect their beloved sister—especially from the likes of a certain stuck-up, rich asshole like Jin Zixuan.</p>
      
      <p>He was a few years older than Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng, although that did not stop either from vowing to beat him up if he ever dared to hurt Yanli.</p>
      
      <p>“Look who's here,” Jiang Cheng whispered under his breath.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying looked around, spotting the older teenager straight away. They were on their way back home from school, looking forward to the upcoming weekend. Of course they had to walk past Jin Zixuan to ruin their mood.</p>
      
      <p>“That guy's so annoying and stuck up, I don't understand what Jiejie sees in him,” Wei Ying said, not bothering to lower his voice.</p>
      
      <p>Almost immediately, Jin Zixuan's head snapped in their direction. “What did you say?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying raised an eyebrow. This was a first. Usually, this jerk didn't bother to acknowledge their existence, thinking he was better than everyone here just because he was rich.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh, you take notice of us now?”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan smirked. “You two are more annoying than that sister of yours.”</p>
      
      <p>Now, it was Jiang Cheng's turn to raise an eyebrow. From the corner of his eyes, Wei Ying could already see Jiang Cheng's hand squeezing into a fist.</p>
      
      <p>“What did you just say?” he said, slowly.</p>
      
      <p>“You heard me. Maybe it runs in the family. She won't stop pestering me when I don't want anything from her—”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan never got to finish his sentence because Wei Ying had already punched him by that time. He managed to land in a few more punches before some adults walking past tore them away from each other. It was worth it to see that jerk with a swollen eye and a bleeding nose, though.</p>
      
      <p>“You'll regret this!” Jin Zixuan hissed as he left.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng snorted at that. What was he going to do? Throw money at them?</p>
      
      <p>As it turned out, Jin Zixuan told his own mother, who obviously told Aunt Yu. While Wei Ying no longer cared for Aunt Yu's opinion of him, he did care that another argument was happening between the Jiang parents by the time he returned home.</p>
      
      <p>“You think it's not obvious? The way you coddle and spoil him? It's obvious to everyone but <em>you!”</em> Aunt Yu's voice echoed through the house.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng had been in the middle of laughing at something Wei Ying said. When he heard his parents arguing again, the mirth on his face drained, replaced by an uncomfortable frown. He looked away from Wei Ying and dropped his bags off at the living room.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying turned to the dining room where the two adults were standing face to face. There was a half opened jewellery box on the table; no doubt another gift Uncle Jiang tried to offer his wife. Aunt Yu did not even spare it a glance.</p>
      
      <p>“What do you want me to do? Neglect the child, ignore him?” Uncle Jiang said.</p>
      
      <p>“You seem to be doing that just fine with A-Cheng.”</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang shook his head. He raised a hand, as if reaching for her, but dropped it in a second. The distance between them remained.</p>
      
      <p>“You know that's not true. I love A-Cheng just as much as I love A-Ying.”</p>
      
      <p>“No. No, you love <em>her!</em> You're still in love with her! Even after all these years, it's about that woman!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying felt his own chest hurt. He knew exactly who they were talking about. He could just about remember his mother's smile whenever she teased Uncle Jiang, poking him in the side and laughing whenever he grew flustered. Uncle Jiang visited them a lot when his parents were still alive, usually drinking with Wei Ying's father during the evening. It never occurred to Wei Ying how frequent those visits were. Did Uncle Jiang spend enough time with his own family?</p>
      
      <p>No, he shouldn't be thinking these things. Uncle Jiang had done so much, <em>so much</em>, for him. Wei Ying owed him his life, <em>at least.</em></p>
      
      <p>“You still doubt my love for you?” Uncle Jiang said, his voice low.</p>
      
      <p>It wasn't right to listen in on their argument. Wei Ying found it impossible to move. He took a deep breath and released it. Would there ever come a time when they would stop fighting about this? He didn't think so.</p>
      
      <p>“How can I not when I see the way you look at Wei Ying?” Aunt Yu spat out his name as if it was acid. “How can I not when he looks exactly like his mother and you <em>adore</em> him?”</p>
      
      <p>“That's <em>enough!”</em></p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang never raised his voice. At least, he didn't use to.</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu, on the other hand, was not one to back down. She raised her voice higher, louder, for the whole house to hear.</p>
      
      <p>“Fine, keep denying it! Keep lying to yourself!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying had heard enough. He left them to argue among themselves, trying to block out their voices. It was always the same. He'd long forgotten what it felt like to live in a house that was not constantly pricked with needles. Memories of his parents laughing and enjoying each other's company seemed like a distant dream to him now.</p>
      
      <p>He found Jiang Cheng and Jiejie in the kitchen. As always, Jiejie greeted him with a lovely smile. The distant voices of her parents yelling in the background could almost be ignored if Wei Ying focused on her face. Almost.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng didn't look up. He was staring into the cup of tea in front of him. It didn't look like he had taken a single sip yet.</p>
      
      <p>Sighing, Jiejie stroked Jiang Cheng's shoulder and beckoned Wei Ying over. “Come here, you two. Let's go upstairs.”</p>
      
      <p>They were quiet even when all three of them were upstairs. Wei Ying laid back on Jiejie's bed, counting the colourful butterfly decorations she had stuck on her ceiling. Jiang Cheng sat beside him, hugging his knees, refusing to say anything. Downstairs, Aunt Yu and Uncle Jiang could still be heard.</p>
      
      <p>“Don't worry,” Jiejie said after a while. “They are only arguing because they care for each other.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng made a muffled noise. He sat up, stretching his legs before him.</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie smiled at him. “You don't believe me? I think... I think if you truly don't care for someone, then you won't bother being upset with them. Deep down, Mom cares because she wants things to work out between her and Dad. If she didn't care, then she'd feel nothing.”</p>
      
      <p>None of them said anything about that. Wei Ying could only sigh, releasing a breath he didn't know he had been holding in all this time. Eventually, the voices downstairs calmed down, but it was difficult to tell if the adults had reconciled or if they simply gave up. Most of the time, it was the latter.</p>
      
      <p>“I think Mom hates Dad,” Jiang Cheng said. His voice was quiet, small. “She's always angry at him.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie shook her head. “No, she loves him. It's just... sometimes, anger is the easiest emotion to let out.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng flinched at that.</p>
      
      <p>At that time, Wei Ying didn't understand her. He had always tried to stick to what his mother told him, to keep smiling, push his problems away and focus on the positives. Why did he need to be angry? What could he be angry for? Who else would he direct those emotions at?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying's life was not perfect, he knew that much, but this was not enough for him to complain. If he had a problem, the only person he could blame was himself. He couldn't burden anyone when he had already been given enough help from the beginning.</p>
      
      <p><em>Just keep smiling.</em> Don't let anyone take it away.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>As much as they hated Jin Zixuan, their sister loved him, and by some twisted turn of events, the jerk loved her all along too. Wei Ying was sixteen when he found out Jiejie was pregnant with her first child.</p>
      
      <p>“She's <em>pregnant?!”</em> Wei Ying choked. “They're not even married! That <em>dick!</em> How <em>dare</em> he!”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng was just as murderous as he was; only, he knew his boundaries. Wei Ying was tempted to travel all the way to that rich bastard's house and kill him for doing this to their Jiejie. Who the fuck cared if Jin Zixuan loved her? The least he could have done was wait until they were married—until they had their family's approval!</p>
      
      <p>“A-Jie told me that... that she doesn't regret anything,” Jiang Cheng mumbled. “Only that she didn't tell us sooner.”</p>
      
      <p>“How are we supposed to know that he didn't force her?”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng's eyes narrowed. “He didn't. I would know.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying clenched his jaw, glaring at the wall in front of him as if it was Jin Zixuan's smug face. What he would give to be able to punch him one more time.</p>
      
      <p>“What do you mean? I don't think Jiejie would be the type to act this rash.”</p>
      
      <p>“She loves him,” Jiang Cheng said, simple as that. “You do stupid things when you're in love.”</p>
      
      <p>Their sister was nineteen now. While she was no longer the girl with the twin braids and butterfly stickers up on her ceiling, she was still their sister. What was going to happen to her now that she was pregnant, with a man she had not even married yet?</p>
      
      <p>“Have Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu said anything?” Wei Ying asked, although already knowing what the answer was.</p>
      
      <p>“I don't know. They were arguing about it when I was there, but I didn't bother to stay.”</p>
      
      <p>Both of them sighed. If Jiejie kept this child, then she would eventually leave them for Jin Zixuan. They would be a family together, regardless of whether Jiang Cheng and Wei Ying hated that very idea. Jiejie would leave, and they would no longer have her comforting smile to distract them from the daily fights that tore their house apart.</p>
      
      <p>What were they going to do?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying never cared for children. When he first laid eyes on Jin Ling, he felt a tenderness in him that he never would have expected. His face broke into a smile he could not control, reaching for the baby's outstretched hand. Jin Ling garbled some nonsense, his small palm squeezing around Wei Ying's finger. At that moment, Wei Ying let out a laugh and asked to hold his nephew, trying to contain the excitement bubbling in him.</p>
      
      <p>“Here you go,” Jiejie said, helping Wei Ying carry Jin Ling into his arms. “You're doing better than A-Cheng. He started crying as soon as he saw A-Ling.”</p>
      
      <p>“A-Jie!” Jiang Cheng hissed, looking away. His cheeks were turning red. “I-I was worried for you! I wasn't crying because of the baby!”</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie only laughed. She was pale and had bags under her eyes, but she had never looked so radiant before. Beside her, Jin Zixuan was stroking her back, staring at his son with a gentleness Wei Ying didn't think he would ever see on his face. For once, he didn't have an urge to punch the stuck up man.</p>
      
      <p>“Hello, you,” Wei Ying said to Jin Ling, nuzzling his little button nose. He lightly weighed the baby in his arms, grinning when Jin Ling focused his eyes on him. “You're so cute, yes you <em>are</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>They were all huddled around Jin Ling. It was perhaps the only time Wei Ying also saw Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu together with no hostility between them. For once, both of them were smiling, admiring their new grandson. It was amazing how one baby could unite a family together, even for a fleeting moment. Wei Ying knew he would treasure this memory for the rest of his life.</p>
      
      <p>“Ah! Are you looking at me? Do you think I'm the more handsome uncle?” Wei Ying said, lightly poking Jin Ling's cheek.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng kicked his chair. “Shut the fuck up!”</p>
      
      <p>“No swearing around my son,” Jin Zixuan said, eyes slightly narrowing.</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie was laughing at their exchanges. She looked up at Jin Zixuan and leaned closer when he stroked her face, softly asking if she was tired. Listening to them there, Wei Ying was reminded of the love his parents had before they disappeared from his life.</p>
      
      <p>His heart ached slightly. For once, he could forgive Jin Zixuan's existence. If he truly made Jiejie happy.... If he managed to give her the love she deserved, then that was enough.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Hey,</em> you're holding him wrong,” Jiang Cheng said. He sat closer to Wei Ying, trying to take Jin Ling away. “He's not comfortable like that.”</p>
      
      <p>“Go away, it's my turn to hold him!” Wei Ying grumbled, moving his seat. He adjusted Jin Ling in his arms and tried to remember how Jiejie was doing it. As long as the baby wasn't crying, then that was fine, wasn't it?</p>
      
      <p>“Both of you, stop fighting,” Aunt Yu sighed. There was no malice in her voice. “You're going to drop A-Ling.”</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying, let me hold him,” Uncle Jiang said. He was already approaching them, arms outstretched.</p>
      
      <p>Reluctantly, Wei Ying allowed his uncle to take his nephew away. He watched as Uncle Jiang showed Aunt Yu their grandson, allowing her to lean in and stroke the baby's hair. Their voices were soft, both talking to Jin Ling under their breaths. Wei Ying could not hear them, but it was enough to know they weren't arguing for once. He sat back on his seat and shared glances with Jiang Cheng, who looked just as relieved.</p>
      
      <p>The brothers smiled at each other. Things were changing, but maybe, just maybe, everything would be okay.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying began to drink in university. It was a new environment where he didn't have to come home to Aunt Yu's disapproving scowls or the sound of arguments spanning for the entire evening. He was older, not exactly more mature, but mature enough that he could look after himself. His grades continued to prosper and everyone said he had a bright future ahead. At the age of eighteen, Wei Ying was happy. He was unstoppable.</p>
      
      <p>“Aaw, come on, Jiang Cheng. Lighten up for once, will you?”</p>
      
      <p>He hooked an arm around Jiang Cheng's shoulder, laughing into his ear. Grumbling, the other half-heartedly tried to shake him off.</p>
      
      <p>“We have exams coming up. Quit messing around.”</p>
      
      <p>“One night out can't hurt.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng raised an eyebrow at him. “This is your <em>fourth</em> night this week.”</p>
      
      <p>Shrugging, Wei Ying waved a hand and dismissed that. He never counted how many times he went out—this was university after all. It was supposed to be a time of not being responsible and drinking your liver to death! Where was the harm in that if his grades didn't suffer?</p>
      
      <p>“Like I said, lighten up! It can't be fun staying here all the time. Come out with us!”</p>
      
      <p>“I'll pass.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying pulled a face. “Killjoy.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng shook him off, returning back to his notes. “Try not to get too drunk. I'm not driving you back home again.”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Aaw</em>, why not?”</p>
      
      <p>“Learn how to drive yourself, idiot.”</p>
      
      <p>They always had this conversation before Wei Ying went out to drink and it still ended with Jiang Cheng giving him a lift back home in the end. He'd yell at Wei Ying and call him an annoying fucker, but Jiang Cheng could never say no to him—even if that meant driving out in the cold at three AM.</p>
      
      <p>And so, Wei Ying left, ready to get absolutely wasted that night.</p>
      
      <p>It started out like it normally did. If Jiang Cheng didn't go out with them then he'd just hang around Huaisang and a bunch of their other friends. By the end of the night, Wei Ying would have met other people too.</p>
      
      <p>Huaisang was a funny drunk. At first, he'd start crying about how scary and loud his brother was, and then as the alcohol started to sink in even more, he'd suddenly start pouncing on the closest guy and making out with them. It used to freak Wei Ying out because he'd have never expected it from someone as meek as Huaisang. Maybe having a strict and controlling brother made him want to loosen up a little bit.</p>
      
      <p>As much as he loved to get drunk, Wei Ying was careful not to get <em>physical</em> with anyone. Believe it or not, he was quite reserved. The only thing that's happened with him was when Mianmian kissed his cheek back in high school—but did that really count if it was a small peck in the dark, so fleeting that Wei Ying was half convinced it was only his imagination? Besides, it was only a kiss on the <em>cheek.</em> Nothing close to a real one.</p>
      
      <p>He hadn't felt <em>sparks</em> yet. He wanted to save that for someone he really cared about, someone that reminded him of how his parents loved each other, not how Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu fought every night. Jiang Cheng would laugh until he broke a rib if he ever found out Wei Ying had this side to him.</p>
      
      <p>Like any other night, Wei Ying drank and drank until the world spun and the colours around him pulsed brighter. He could barely remember what happened, only that Huaisang was sick somewhere behind a tree and Wei Ying was very tempted to join him. Maybe he drank far too much so early into the night. It was barely even eleven PM yet; they definitely started too soon.</p>
      
      <p>Although it was shameful to leave now, Wei Ying suddenly found his bed more appealing than dancing in a crowded club. Huaisang was still vomiting behind a bush but insisted he wanted to return inside with their friends. <em>Go ahead</em>, Wei Ying thought, not envying the hangover Huaisang would surely get in the morning.</p>
      
      <p>He ambled through the dark streets before finally taking his phone out. Jiang Cheng would pick him up. Or he would... if he answered his phone. Groaning, Wei Ying called him several more times, glaring at Jiang Cheng's picture on his screen. That jerk couldn't be asleep now, right? <em>Right?</em> Was he purposely ignoring Wei Ying so he wouldn't need to drive him home? How mean.</p>
      
      <p>All the alcohol he drank was starting to not feel so good. With no other option, Wei Ying stumbled through the streets, trying to remember if his dorms were down that street... or <em>that</em> street.</p>
      
      <p>A car slowly stopped by him. Wei Ying spun around, swaying on his feet. The windows rolled down and he grinned as soon as he saw Uncle Jiang's face staring back.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying?”</p>
      
      <p>“Uncle Jiang!” he cried.</p>
      
      <p>Behind his uncle, he could see Aunt Yu sitting on the passenger seat. As usual, she didn't look happy—but when did she ever?</p>
      
      <p>“What are you two doing here?” Wei Ying asked, still swaying. He squeezed his cheeks between his palms in an attempt to sober up a little, not realising that only made him look more drunk than he already was.</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, Uncle Jiang's smile widened even more. “Your Aunt and I went out for dinner. We were just on our way home.”</p>
      
      <p><em>Dinner?</em> Did that mean they finally stopped fighting?</p>
      
      <p>“That's... That's good!” Wei Ying said. “I hope you two live a happy and long life!”</p>
      
      <p>He honestly didn't know what he was rambling on about anymore. That was what they said at weddings, as far as he could remember. It seemed like a fitting thing to say at that time.</p>
      
      <p>Aunt Yu's sigh was loud and impatient. “He's drunk.”</p>
      
      <p>Uncle Jiang chuckled under his breath. He motioned his head towards the back of the car. “I'll drive you back, A-Ying. It's not safe to walk out here at night by yourself.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying dove inside the car without needing to be told twice. It was warm and comfortable here, nothing like the horrible freezing weather outside. He wanted nothing more than to go back to his bed and pray he wouldn't get a hangover tomorrow morning.</p>
      
      <p>He closed his eyes, remembering to put his seatbelt on even in his drunken state. He was starting to fall asleep, vaguely listening to his adopted parents talking. As their conversation continued, Wei Ying noticed they were too loud to just be having a normal talk. He cracked open one eye and saw Aunt Yu glaring at her husband, shaking her head at whatever he was saying. Uncle Jiang, too, was shaking his head, frowning at her with a tired look on his face. They were arguing, as usual, but Wei Ying was too sleepy to find out why.</p>
      
      <p>He shifted in his seat, trying to get comfortable. His eyelids were getting heavier and heavier.</p>
      
      <p>That was when he saw it. Lights. A car swerving in their direction.</p>
      
      <p>His eyes widened.</p>
      
      <p>He didn't know who screamed first. All he saw was the blinding glare of the headlights and Uncle Jiang frantically spinning the wheel.</p>
      
      <p>Then, the whole world spun and plunged everything into black.</p>
      
      <p>He didn't feel anything, not at first. There was an endless ringing in his ears and a hollow void that threatened to swallow him whole. It was all Wei Ying could see, could feel. He was numb and it felt like that was all there ever would be. Part of him wondered if he was already dead. If so, then why did it feel too easy? He expected more.</p>
      
      <p>The ringing didn't stop, not even when his eyes opened.</p>
      
      <p>He thought he saw someone in the distance, watching. A woman, dressed in white, and then he blinked and she was gone.</p>
      
      <p>Pain followed soon after. The void was gone and he was thrown back into the wreckage he was in. He gasped, now aware of the gash on his head, the blood trickling down his face. There was a piece of metal lodged straight into his thigh. Just looking at it was enough to get him to start heaving.</p>
      
      <p>“U-Uncle... Jiang...” Wei Ying called out. He fumbled to take off his seatbelt, breathing through his mouth when every move he made only made his leg explode with agony.</p>
      
      <p>Shaking, he gripped the piece of metal stuck inside his thigh but quickly let go. He couldn't take it out. He was too scared.</p>
      
      <p>“Uncle!” Wei Ying called again. He gripped onto the seat in front of him and tried to crane his neck, searching for the two adults.</p>
      
      <p>What he saw first drained all the blood in his body.</p>
      
      <p>The car that had crashed into them had rolled onto their bonnet, crushing the front part with its weight. Wei Ying scrambled forward, ignoring the searing pain in his limbs, and choked at the sight he was met with. He couldn't breathe. He was hyperventilating and shaking.</p>
      
      <p>He didn't even know where the wreckage began and ended. All he saw were the limp bodies of Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu, crushed under the metal. He couldn't see their legs, he couldn't even see if they were breathing—if they were still <em>alive.</em></p>
      
      <p>The blood. There was so much blood. He was thrown back to the night he lost his parents right in front of him; that was the last thought he had before he started screaming.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>He must have passed out. When he awoke, he was met with white walls, the stench of something sterile, clean. His whole body didn't feel like it belonged to him; his limbs were too weak, his mind too empty. He wanted to stay there and stare at the white ceiling for eternity, not have to find out why they were needles in his arms and why he wanted to burst into tears.</p>
      
      <p>It was all a bad dream, it had to be. He just got too drunk... He was still drunk. He would wake up, back in his dorms, with Jiang Cheng shrieking down his ear. This was all a nightmare.</p>
      
      <p>He kept his eyes on the ceiling, refusing to look around. None of this was real. None of that happened.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ying.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie's voice tugged at him. He could already feel his eyes stinging, unable to ignore her. Reluctantly, he turned to her, immediately regretting it when he saw her swollen eyes, the dark bags under them. He had never seen her without her smile, not even when she was sad about their parents fighting.</p>
      
      <p>He swallowed the lump in his throat. Beside her, Jiang Cheng was sat by his bed, staring off into the distance. He didn't blink or say anything, or even move. He didn't even seem to be breathing.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying struggled for words.</p>
      
      <p>“Jiang Cheng, I—”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng's hand shot like a viper. Within seconds, he was gripping Wei Ying's collar, pulling him off the bed.</p>
      
      <p>“They're dead! They're both <em>dead!”</em></p>
      
      <p>His words were knives being plunged into Wei Ying's chest. They echoed; <em>dead, dead</em>, and Wei Ying saw their mangled remains right in front of his eyes. He heard the car's impact, the world shattering around him. Glass, metal, Uncle Jiang's lifeless face staring ahead of the road. <em>Dead.</em></p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng was shaking him, screaming. Wei Ying heard none of it. He wanted to be sick.</p>
      
      <p>“I-I didn't—”</p>
      
      <p>“I told you not to go out! <em>I told you!</em> And you just had to drag my parents into it! They're <em>dead!”</em></p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying did not know what to say.</p>
      
      <p>If he had never crossed paths with them, Uncle Jiang wouldn't have needed to drive that way. He would have returned home, with Aunt Yu, alive and well.</p>
      
      <p>What had he done?</p>
      
      <p><em>What had he done?</em></p>
      
      <p>After everything they did for him.... Offering him a home, taking care of him, giving him a <em>family.</em> He had always thought he would repay Uncle Jiang in the future. Once he was older, once he had his life sorted out, he would make sure to give Uncle Jiang what he deserved, <em>whatever</em> that may have been. Wei Ying would have done anything to repay him.</p>
      
      <p>Instead, he killed Uncle Jiang and his wife. They were gone. Dead.</p>
      
      <p>He couldn't say anything. What could he say? What could he do?</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng's cries were loud and they filled the whole room until it was all Wei Ying could hear. His hands trembled as he clung onto Wei Ying, sobbing into his neck.</p>
      
      <p>“They're dead... My parents are dead,” Jiang Cheng wept. His voice was muffled by Wei Ying's hospital gown, soaking the thin material within seconds.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying was pathetic. His hands rose to wrap themselves around Jiang Cheng, but he could not say anything to comfort him. How could he? What gave him the right to comfort him, when it was his fault to begin with? Even embracing Jiang Cheng felt wrong. He was pathetic, so pathetic.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Cheng. A-Ying.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie's voice was gentle, as always. She gathered both boys into her arms and the three of them remained there, listening to each other's breaths. Eventually, Jiang Cheng's sobs subsided into tired tremors that shook his chest. As much as he wanted, Wei Ying did not dare to cry. It was all his fault. He shouldn't be here, craving for comfort, when this was all because of him.</p>
      
      <p>“Please, don't fight,” Jiejie said. “Please.”</p>
      
      <p>They said nothing. In the end, she tightened her arms around them even more, as if it was the only thing keeping their lives together.</p>
