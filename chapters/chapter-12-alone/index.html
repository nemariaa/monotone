      <p>Wei Ying is more than content to stay in this warm bed. Lan Zhan has laid them back down and the temptation to close his eyes and sleep the day away is very tempting. He snuggles closer to the warmth, breathing in sandalwood. The even beats of Lan Zhan's pulse, his gentle breaths, the almost inaudible <em>tick-tock, tick-tock</em> of a distant clock; it all sounds like a lullaby pulling him back to his dreams. He takes another deep breath and releases it, relaxing his whole body—</p>

      <p><em>Wait.</em> Wei Ying's eyes snap open. He sits up, looking at the clock on the wall. The whole world spins and comes crashing back down when he sees the time. It's past eleven AM? What the fuck?</p>
      
      <p>“Oh <em>shit</em>,” he says, shoving the blankets off him. “I have work!”</p>
      
      <p>His mind conjures up an image of Shen Yuan giving him his signature cold glare. The man rarely lost his cool but if you managed to piss him off then you were in for it. Being over two hours late for work will definitely piss him off. Wei Ying can't even think of an excuse with this headache!</p>
      
      <p>His surroundings are slowly starting to spin again the longer he sits up. Teaching like this is going to be impossible—and that's if he even manages to get to the school in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>Beside him, Lan Zhan sits up. “Doctor Wen has already called the school to tell them you are unwell today.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying turns to him, frowning. “Huh?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan rises with all the grace in the world. Wei Ying is still on the bed, his hair standing up in every direction, looking like a bear has just mauled him to death. He watches as Lan Zhan combs his hair, inky black strands flowing like water past his fingertips. The difference between them would be funny if Wei Ying doesn't currently feel like death will hurt less than this hangover.</p>
      
      <p>“She called your phone earlier,” Lan Zhan explains, twisting his hair into a loose bun. “I told her you were unwell. She said she would inform your headmaster.”</p>
      
      <p>That... makes things easier, at least.</p>
      
      <p>“What exactly did you tell her?” Wei Ying asks. He's not sure he wants to know the answer.</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan hesitates for a second. “She already knew you had been drinking. She went to your apartment and saw the state it was in.” He pauses as Wei Ying lets out a string of curses. “I reassured her you were fine.”</p>
      
      <p>Great. Wei Ying holds his head in his hands. Most people had the fortune of forgetting what dumb shit they get up to when they're drunk but Wei Ying has never had that privilege. No matter how much he drinks or how much of a mess he becomes, he'll remember everything the next morning. Today isn't any different.</p>
      
      <p>He clearly remembers how many empty bottles were left on the floor in his living room. Didn't he smash that bottle of vodka too? Wen Qing knows where he keeps his spare key so she would have been able to get inside, only to find his apartment looking like someone's just broken into it.</p>
      
      <p>Fuck.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying lets out a sigh. “I'll call her later... I'm sorry about that.”</p>
      
      <p>He stands up, and immediately regrets it. The room literally tips over and his stomach lurches. Wei Ying covers his mouth, swallowing back the bile just in time. He pushes Lan Zhan out of the way and dives into what he thinks is the bathroom, locking it before proceeding to throw up into the fancy looking toilet.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying can barely hear Lan Zhan's voice over the sounds of him heaving everything out his stomach. He hasn't felt this horrible in—fuck, how many years? Why did he decide to drink so much last night? He's too old to be dealing with hangovers like this.</p>
      
      <p>The door rattles dangerously. Weakly, Wei Ying looks up. If Lan Zhan keeps doing that then he's going to tear the door right off its hinges.</p>
      
      <p>“No, wait,” Wei Ying grumbles. <em>Let me die in peace,</em> Lan Zhan. He groans some more, slumping against the bathroom wall.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you okay?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying glares at the door, his head pounding. “I'm having the time of my life, Lan Zhan.”</p>
      
      <p>“Unlock the door.”</p>
      
      <p>He barely finishes that sentence before Wei Ying is lunging for the toilet again. He retches and splutters, wincing at the horrible taste filling his mouth. Over the years, he's managed to hold his alcohol down pretty well. It's been a literal decade since he's been sick <em>this</em> badly.</p>
      
      <p>“You really want to see me puking my guts out?” Wei Ying says afterwards, wiping his mouth. “I don't look cute like this.”</p>
      
      <p>“Stop joking around. You are not well.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying throws another scowl at the door. “No shit.”</p>
      
      <p>He hears Lan Zhan sigh. “Do you need anything?”</p>
      
      <p>It takes a while for Wei Ying to answer. He blinks several times, clutching his stomach. There is still the ringing in his ears and the non-stop <em>battering</em> in his head, but he thinks the urge to be sick is gone. For now. That will probably change if he tries to stand up again; all the better to stay here on the floor and pretend this is the afterlife instead.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying groans. He slowly turns around, scanning the bathroom. It's very large, much bigger than his own bedroom—probably even bigger than his living room <em>and</em> kitchen put together. The walls and the floor are spotless white marble, and the counters are a contrasting black. In the centre of the room is a circular hot tub raised on a platform, surrounded by candles and incense sticks.</p>
      
      <p>He pulls himself up to his feet, flushing the toilet. Every step he takes feels like an earthquake, but he ignores it for now. He walks past the tub, finding another section around the corner of the room much to his surprise. There is a walk-in shower, by the looks of it, encased in black marble and glass.</p>
      
      <p>He shakes his head to himself. How rich exactly is Lan Zhan? This bathroom alone is probably more expensive than Wei Ying's whole rent.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying leaves the shower, rushing back to where the toilet is. Lan Zhan is trying to open the door again.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying, are you there?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, sorry,” he says. “I was exploring your fancy bathroom.”</p>
      
      <p>“Unlock the door.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head. “Nope.”</p>
      
      <p><em>“Wei Ying.”</em></p>
      
      <p>“Lan Zhan, let me get cleaned up first. I feel filthy. Can I use your shower?”</p>
      
      <p>Well, that gets Lan Zhan to leave the door alone. It stops rattling, and Wei Ying thinks he hears the quiet sound of him taking a deep breath.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes,” Lan Zhan eventually says.</p>
      
      <p>“Do you have a spare toothbrush anywhere?”</p>
      
      <p>“Hmm. The second drawer, next to the mirror.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying follows his instructions. Not only is there dozens of spare toothbrushes, but also toothpaste, shampoos, shower gels, everything. You'd think Lan Zhan is hoarding them for an apocalypse! He muffles a chuckle behind his hand, shaking his head to himself.</p>
      
      <p>“Shower,” Lan Zhan commands. “I will make you some breakfast.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror, wincing at how much of a mess he looks.</p>
      
      <p>“Lan Zhan, before you go,” he says. “Do you have some spare clothes I can borrow too? Anything will do.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan is only half a head taller than him. Wei Ying can probably fit into his clothes just fine.</p>
      
      <p>“I will see.”</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you, Lan Zhan.”</p>
      
      <p>Finally, he hears Lan Zhan walking off. When his footsteps fade into nothing, Wei Ying releases a sigh of relief.</p>
      
      <p><em>What a mess,</em> he thinks, still staring at himself. Even when he combs his fingers through his hair and tidies it up a bit, it doesn't stop him from looking like someone in a horror movie.</p>
      
      <p>To make things worse, his brain chooses this fine moment to give him some much needed flashbacks from last night. Wei Ying covers his face, remembering the way he practically manhandled Lan Zhan onto his bed. No, he mentally screams. He can never face him ever again. Wei Ying will never leave this bathroom.</p>
      
      <p>He groans for the umpteenth time today and pulls a face at his reflection. No use sulking now, at least not until he looks presentable again.</p>
      
      <p>With that, he drags himself to Lan Zhan's posh shower room. One side of this room is a whole window overlooking the lush fields. The shower itself has frosted glass which will prevent you from being seeing with your bits out, but he can't say he's comfortable with that unnecessarily large window. He narrows his eyes at the view outside, seeing nothing but grass and trees.</p>
      
      <p><em>Fuck it,</em> he thinks. He's too hungover for this.</p>
      
      <p>He steps inside the shower and sheds his clothes off, throwing them over the side. From the looks of it, it's one of those fancy showers that rains down; the entire section of the ceiling above him is a whole shower head itself. This thing alone can fit a group of people, let alone just one person. He's surrounded by black marble dark enough to show his reflection if he squints, patterned with fine, silver cracks. It's a pretty shower. A bit over the top though.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying frowns at the contraption above him, and then towards these several faucets. Which one turns this thing on? He turns what he thinks is supposed to be the one to get it to start working—and gasps as <em>freezing</em> cold water is dumped onto his head.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying jumps out of the way, pressing himself against the marble walls. Okay, he's got it to start working—now how can he get it to <em>not</em> give him hypothermia? He hurriedly turns another faucet and prays it's the option for the temperature.</p>
      
      <p>Nope. The shower is now raining down like a fucking monsoon. Wei Ying stares at it with wide eyes, fearing for his life.</p>
      
      <p>“Fuck this thing,” he mutters, fumbling along the wall for another faucet. This is ridiculous. He's hungover, cold, <em>and</em> naked. If he didn't care so much about his pride, he'd be screaming for Lan Zhan to fix his damn shower.</p>
      
      <p>He gives up on the faucets and presses one of the buttons instead, using a little too much force. As Wei Ying stands there, drenched, frozen, and pissed off, the shower starts playing classical music on full volume.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh my fucking <em>god</em>,” Wei Ying snaps, slamming his fist down on that same button. The classical music doesn't stop. It switches to dubstep.</p>
      
      <p>At this point, he's not sure if it's the freezing water soaking him or he's actually started crying.</p>
      
      <p>“Fuck you, fuck you, <em>fuck you</em>,” Wei Ying says to this monstrosity Lan Zhan calls a shower. He jabs several buttons, doing everything from increasing the volume to even switching on some flashing lights to accommodate with the dubstep music. This shower does everything apart from fucking <em>heat up!</em></p>
      
      <p>He throws his hands in the air. Is this a joke? Does this shower actually work? Who pays for this shit?! He screams one last time before admitting defeat. He'll just ask Lan Zhan how the fuck this thing works!</p>
      
      <p>Grumbling to himself, he walks through the freezing monsoon and makes his way for the exit.</p>
      
      <p>Then, something catches his eye. There, next to the shower's door, is a touch screen panel, with the clear options of changing the temperature.</p>
      
      <p>Oh.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying stares at it for a whole minute, still standing underneath the downpour of freezing cold water. He didn't see that. He'd been so focused on all the faucets that he didn't notice there was a panel right behind him. At this point, he has literally grown numb. Slowly, he raises a finger and chooses the temperature he wants. In an instant, the shower heats up.</p>
      
      <p>It's as easy as that.</p>
      
      <p>Oh.</p>
      
      <p>He unclenches his fists and walks back to the centre. Wei Ying glares up at the shower, mentally throwing it every swear word known to man. He's hungover, cold, naked, <em>and</em> he wants to fight an inanimate object. Today is off to a great start.</p>
      
      <p>At the very least, the shower feels good once you get it going. He begrudgingly turns the music and flashing lights off. Why you would even need those in the first place, he will never know. Wei Ying soaks himself under the water, closing his eyes. The tension in his muscles is washed away and he stands there for ten minutes, staring off into space. It takes a while for him to shake off his murderous intentions for the shower but he eventually lets his mind wander elsewhere.</p>
      
      <p>He's always had this rule he stuck with throughout the years: Never stay over at someone else's house. Granted, he didn't have sex with Lan Zhan, but still, he shouldn't be here. He stopped caring about the significance of intimacy a long time ago. That, however, doesn't mean he's willing to get attached. Attachment is the one thing Wei Ying has been avoiding the most.</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, he finds he doesn't care about that right now. He's got other things to be worrying about. Jiejie is still in hospital, deteriorating with each day. For all he knows, she could be...</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying can't bring himself to finish that train of thought. He grabs some shampoo and washes his hair. For the rest of the shower, he focuses on the water and nothing but the water. He doesn't want to think this morning.</p>
      
      <p>When he is done, he uses one of Lan Zhan's spare towels and dries himself off. His head is still hurting but it no longer feels like an elephant has been dropped on him. A bear now, maybe. He wraps the towel around his waist and gathers his dirty clothes, eager to leave this demonic bathroom.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying peeks a head out from the door, narrowing his eyes at Lan Zhan's bedroom. There's no one here; he's probably downstairs still cooking. He breathes a sigh of relief and steps out, immediately spotting the pile of clothes left for him on the bed.</p>
      
      <p>He was only expecting a shirt and some pants. Of course, Lan Zhan outdoes himself and provides him with a whole outfit, including underwear and some socks. He's even provided Wei Ying some hair ties for his hair, in case he wants to put it up.</p>
      
      <p>Before he realises it, he's smiling. The thought of Lan Zhan laying this out for him and neatly presenting it onto the bed is... oddly endearing.</p>
      
      <p>The smile is wiped off his face when he puts on Lan Zhan's shirt. Lan Zhan isn't that much taller than he is, no, but it doesn't occur to Wei Ying he could be more... built. Wei Ying glares at his reflection, unhappy at how baggy this shirt looks on him. It doesn't help the sleeves are also too long. Lan Zhan's eagerness in providing him everything is now a blessing. If it weren't for a belt, Wei Ying is sure these pants would have fallen off him by now.</p>
      
      <p>He checks his reflection again. In the end, he shrugs to himself. At least he looks better than he did last night. He's too lazy to do anything with his hair, only towel drying and quickly combing it with a brush. After he's done brushing his teeth, he finally deems himself presentable and leaves the bedroom.</p>
      
      <p>He instantly recognises the unmistakable scent of congee coming from downstairs. His stomach rumbles and he quickens his steps, already finding the table laid out with all of the food. Lan Zhan is sitting down, sipping his coffee while waiting for him. Today, he's wearing a white V-neck sweater and grey trousers. Nothing special about that, although Lan Zhan's rolled the sleeves of his sweater up to his elbows, distracting Wei Ying for a few seconds because of how nice his arms look. It's annoying how he manages to pull off any outfit.</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan's golden eyes lift up. Wei Ying stops, letting Lan Zhan's gaze travel up and down his body. He fidgets under his scrutiny, not knowing why he's looking at him like that. Does he look silly? It's because Lan Zhan's clothes are too big for him, isn't it? Wei Ying hasn't even bothered to dry his hair yet—he must look like a mess compared to the musician.</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan is the first one to break eye contact. He takes another sip of his drink.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you feeling better?” he asks.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying almost tells him about the disaster that is his shower, then decides against it. He wants to keep some semblance of pride he has left, even if he has now formed a grudge against Lan Zhan's fancy bathroom. “A bit,” he says instead.</p>
      
      <p>He sits opposite Lan Zhan at the table. It reminds him of that dinner they had a while ago, back when he vowed he didn't want anything to do with Lan Zhan. Now... well, he's not sure. It's difficult to think now. Not with everything going on.</p>
      
      <p>Just eat, Wei Ying thinks. Maybe his common sense will come back to him once he's got a full stomach.</p>
      
      <p>The congee tastes nice and reminds him a lot of what breakfast used to be like at the Jiang household. Jiejie always made this before the three of them left for school. Uncle Jiang and Aunt Yu were too drowsy from sleep to argue; it was one of the rare times their house was actually peaceful. Once, Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng tried to cook their own version of congee because they missed their sister. It was going well—that is, until Wei Ying decided to dump half a handful of chilli powder into the mix. Suffice it to say, Jiang Cheng refused to eat the final product.</p>
      
      <p>He sighs, shoving another spoonful into his mouth. Hearing this, Lan Zhan glances up at him.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying keeps his eyes on the bowl, stirring what's left inside. Lan Zhan has barely said anything this morning. He half expected him to ask all sorts of questions, demanding why he felt the need to drink so much. Maybe he doesn't care.</p>
      
      <p>That thought doesn't sit well with Wei Ying. He finishes the rest of the congee, wishing Lan Zhan would at least say <em>something.</em></p>
      
      <p>Unable to take it anymore, Wei Ying looks up. Lan Zhan is still staring. As soon as he catches sight of those golden eyes, he loses his nerve and averts his gaze away. Just last night, he threw himself onto this man and literally <em>begged</em> to be fucked. Of course Lan Zhan isn't going to talk to him! He's probably waiting for him to leave now!</p>
      
      <p>“I'm sorry for last night. I don't know what came over me,” Wei Ying blurts out.</p>
      
      <p>In the corner of his eyes, he sees Lan Zhan shake his head. “It is fine. You... remember everything?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying can do nothing to stop the blush spreading onto his cheeks. If only he could forget the memory of him climbing on top of Lan Zhan, forcing his lips on him. Fuck, he even tried to undress him, didn't he? It's a miracle Lan Zhan even let him stay after that.</p>
      
      <p>“More or less,” he admits. “I was shameless last night, Lan Zhan, you didn't deserve that. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.”</p>
      
      <p>“I said it is fine, but you should not drink so much.”</p>
      
      <p>Surprisingly, there's no anger in his voice. Relief spreads through Wei Ying, enough that he gathers the courage to stare at Lan Zhan again. Devoid of any emotions whatsoever, Lan Zhan's face is the same as usual. Wei Ying's eyes travel down to his lips. He can recall kissing Lan Zhan but he can't remember what it <em>felt</em> like...</p>
      
      <p>Why is he even thinking about this?!</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying coughs quietly, scanning the house instead. It's eerily quiet.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm guessing Sizhui's gone to school?”</p>
      
      <p>“Hmm.”</p>
      
      <p>“Don't you have work?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan shakes his head.</p>
      
      <p>Silence.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying sips his coffee, counting down the seconds that pass between them. Is this what it feels like to live with Lan Zhan? Normally, he'll fill any silence in a room but it feels wrong to do that with what happened between them last night. He taps his fingers on the table, watching the musician from the corner of his eyes.</p>
      
      <p>In the end, he can't take it anymore.</p>
      
      <p>“Aren't you going to ask any questions?” he says.</p>
      
      <p>“Only if you are ready to talk.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying frowns. He didn't expect that. Is he ready? Probably not. But this lack of talking is killing him; he'd rather things not be awkward between both of them.</p>
      
      <p>“Go on then, ask,” Wei Ying insists, gesturing towards himself.</p>
      
      <p>For a moment, Lan Zhan looks like he hesitates. He lets go of his cup of coffee, perfectly aligning it with the bowl in front of him.</p>
      
      <p>“You were asking me what you were supposed to do, and that you had never meant for certain things to happen,” he says. “What did you mean by that?”</p>
      
      <p>“Didn't I already tell you? My adopted parents died because of me... Jiejie is in hospital right now...” Wei Ying's frown deepens, remembering his encounter with Jiang Cheng. “Jin Ling was sent home early yesterday. I figured there was something wrong, so I went to Jiang Cheng's apartment to ask him what was happening.”</p>
      
      <p><em>She's getting worse. The doctors don't know if she's going to make it by the end of the week. Is that what you want to hear?</em></p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying grips the table. “I'm worried she doesn't have much time left.”</p>
      
      <p>“What... is wrong with her?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don't know. Jiang Cheng wouldn't tell me anything.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan slowly nods. “Where is she?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying looks up, tilting his head. “Jiejie? She's in Ohio right now. Her husband admitted her to a private hospital there.”</p>
      
      <p>Speaking of which, he should call Jin Zixuan and get some answers from him... How ironic it is that it's easier to speak to <em>him</em> now compared to Jiang Cheng. Back when they were kids, Wei Ying was always getting into fights with the older man. Luckily, Jin Zixuan has matured considerably ever since he got together with Jiejie.</p>
      
      <p>Just then, the shrill noise of his phone makes him jump. He takes it out of his pocket, groaning at the sight of Wen Qing's photo.</p>
      
      <p>“Fuck, it's Wen Qing,” he says, standing up. “Excuse me, I have a feeling she's about to yell at me.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan nods. Bracing himself against Wen Qing's upcoming tirade, Wei Ying runs to another room. Lan Zhan doesn't need to witness this.</p>
      
      <p>He takes a deep breath and answers the call.</p>
      
      <p>“Wen Qing—”</p>
      
      <p>“So you <em>are</em> alive!”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying flinches. “I'm sorry, I never meant to—”</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ning told me you got drunk. How much exactly did you drink?”</p>
      
      <p>His words fall short. Lying to Wen Qing is useless; she's already been to his apartment and seen all of the empty bottles.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying.”</p>
      
      <p>“Just a few cans of beer... Some wine...” Wei Ying pauses, gulping. “And half a bottle of vodka.”</p>
      
      <p>Her breath hitches from the other line. “<em>Half</em> a bottle?”</p>
      
      <p>He squints. “Maybe a bit more.”</p>
      
      <p>“Are you trying to kill yourself?!” she snaps, her voice rising several octaves higher. Then, she sighs. “Actually, don't answer that. We're <em>not</em> going through this again, Wei Ying. I'm not standing here and watching you ruin your life again.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying rubs his head, pacing around the room. He's glad this conversation isn't taking place face to face. It's bad enough having to listen to Wen Qing worry; he doesn't think he'd be able to take seeing her face either. He swallows the lump in his throat, his chest now filled with the heavy weight of guilt.</p>
      
      <p>“I know, I know. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't even mean to drink that much, I just... I got emotional.”</p>
      
      <p>She is quiet. Over the years he's known Wen Qing, she's only ever quiet if she's genuinely upset or angry. Wei Ying would prefer it if she is angry. He hates upsetting her.</p>
      
      <p>“I threw away all the alcohol you had left,” she says after a while.</p>
      
      <p>He stops pacing. “I guess I deserve that. I... I'm sorry. I really am.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying hears another sigh coming from her. His gaze flickers to the clock; it's just gone past twelve in the afternoon. She's likely calling him during her lunch break. Wen Qing is already busy enough as it is; the thought of her taking time out of her own breaks just to see if he's okay doesn't bode well with Wei Ying. Not for the first time today, the guilt inside him swells up.</p>
      
      <p>“Where are you now?” Wen Qing asks.</p>
      
      <p>“Lan Zhan's house...”</p>
      
      <p>“That guy you went on a date with? Wait—no, you didn't...”</p>
      
      <p>He quickly shakes his head, as if she can see him. “<em>No</em>, nothing happened between us. I think I tried to do something but he wouldn't have it.”</p>
      
      <p>“Oh? But he let you stay the night?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes. He even let me have a shower this morning. <em>And</em> cooked me breakfast.”</p>
      
      <p>Wen Qing lets out what sounds like an amused <em>hmph!</em> “He's nice. I like him. And I think he likes you too.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying scoffs. His cheeks heat up, much to his dismay. “What is this, high school?” he mumbles. “But yeah, he is nice...”</p>
      
      <p>His brain betrays him again, playing back more memories. He refuses to dwell any more on their kiss, but he thinks back to how nice Lan Zhan's arms were around him. Although the dreams he had were far from pleasant, Lan Zhan's presence helped him forget them in an instant.</p>
      
      <p><em>Stop it</em>, Wei Ying thinks to himself. He shakes his head until it begins to pound again. His hangover is still killing him and these thoughts aren't helping either.</p>
      
      <p>“So what happened anyway?” Wen Qing asks. “What was so bad that you decided to drink that much?”</p>
      
      <p>The thought of having to tell her all about his fight with Jiang Cheng only makes his headache worse. Wei Ying suppresses the groan he wants to let out.</p>
      
      <p>“I'll text you everything later. My head's killing me,” he says.</p>
      
      <p>“That's what you get for drinking almost a whole bottle of vodka, you idiot.”</p>
      
      <p>He smiles at her tone. That's more like the usual Wen Qing. “Love you too, goodbye.”</p>
      
      <p>“Take care of yourself. Don't do anything stupid.”</p>
      
      <p>She hangs up before he can tell her that doing stupid things is practically part of his existence. He places his phone back into his pocket, wondering what he should do now. Every time he moves, it literally feels like his head is splitting apart—but that's hangovers for you. He should be thankful he's not being sick anymore.</p>
      
      <p>The sensible option would be to ask Lan Zhan to drive him back home where he can rest all day. That way, he won't have to disturb anyone either. Lan Zhan can go back to a peaceful life where he's not having a random drunk jump on him, and Wei Ying can return to being lonely. How depressing.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shuffles his feet. Does he really want to stay here all day? Should he? There's still the matter with Jiejie to sort out, but he knows he's not going to be able to face that now. At least not with this hangover. If he goes back home, he'll just sulk even more and probably do something stupid, as Wen Qing quotes it. He's not good with depressing thoughts; he'll try to distract himself and usually that will come in the form of either drinking or something equally reckless.</p>
      
      <p>So, really, he should stay with Lan Zhan, right?</p>
      
      <p>He doesn't even know what he's trying to justify. Wei Ying shrugs to himself and leaves the room, returning to where Lan Zhan is sat.</p>
      
      <p>“So," he says, “she did yell at me.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan nods.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying wrings his hands together. Well, here goes nothing...</p>
      
      <p>“Would it be too much trouble for you if I stayed here, at least until this hangover goes away?” he asks. “I feel like I've been stabbed in the head.”</p>
      
      <p>The only change in Lan Zhan's face is that he blinks. There isn't a hint of surprise in his expression, and if there is then he's very good at hiding it.</p>
      
      <p>“Stay as long as you need,” he says.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying lets out a laugh. “Lan Zhan, don't say things you don't mean. What if I stay forever?”</p>
      
      <p>“Hmm.”</p>
      
      <p>“Hmm? What's that supposed to mean?”</p>
      
      <p>Instead of answering him, the musician rises and begins to stack all of their bowls. Wei Ying hurries to help him.</p>
      
      <p>“You are not well. Rest,” Lan Zhan says. “I will handle these.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying's hands fall limp by his side. “If you insist...”</p>
      
      <p>He leaves Lan Zhan to do the washing up and makes his way to the living room instead. There's a sofa there that looks comfortable enough to lay on for the rest of the day, surrounded by plump cushions—and, oh look, it even has a blanket neatly folded for Wei Ying to use. He sits down and spreads the blanket over himself, smiling at the familiar scent of sandalwood. On the sides of the sofa are buttons that enable it to raise the ends, turning it into a makeshift bed.</p>
      
      <p>Now <em>this</em> is much better than Lan Zhan's fancy bathroom. Wei Ying sinks down the sofa and snuggles into his blanket, grabbing a random cushion to hug. This thing is even comfier than his own bed back in his apartment. He'd happily fall asleep here.</p>
      
      <p>“Your house is so nice, Lan Zhan—well, most of it. Your bathroom confused me earlier and I almost had a fight with your shower, but this sofa is nice. I don't know how you can deal with that shower every morning though, Lan Zhan. You've wasted money on that thing.” Wei Ying rambles on, glancing over his shoulder. He sees Lan Zhan walking towards him, every step making him look like a catwalk model.</p>
      
      <p>“The shower?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, the shower. All the options are so confusing!”</p>
      
      <p>“Use the hot tub next time.”</p>
      
      <p>“That thing's too much—wait, next time?” Wei Ying quickly looks away, sinking further down into the blanket. “A-Anyway, doesn't it get lonely here though? It's only you and Sizhui, isn't it?”</p>
      
      <p>He quickly changes the subject, only because he doesn't want his treacherous mind to start running away with the idea of coming back to this place, <em>especially</em> if it's to use Lan Zhan's hot tub.</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan leans against a pillar. “I am used to it.”</p>
      
      <p>“Used to being lonely? That's not good.” Wei Ying pats the space next to him, beckoning the other man over. “Sit next to me, Lan Zhan. It's not fun talking with you across the room.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan takes a seat on the other side of the sofa. He's so far away you would think Wei Ying's hangover is contagious.</p>
      
      <p>“You can sit closer, you know...”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan inches a bit closer.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying pouts. “Now you're starting to offend me.”</p>
      
      <p>Seeing as Lan Zhan won't do it, Wei Ying takes the liberty of closing the distance and throwing the blanket over both of them. The blanket isn't very large, therefore he has to squeeze against Lan Zhan to fit under. He feels the other man stiffen beside him but Lan Zhan doesn't move away. Eventually, the musician relaxes, smoothing down the blanket over their laps and ridding it off any creases. His touch, even with the blanket over them, tickles.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying turns to the large TV. “Do you have Netflix? Let's watch something.”</p>
      
      <p>“Netflix?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yeah, Netflix. You have it, don't you?”</p>
      
      <p>Like a marble statue, Lan Zhan's expression is as stiff as ever.</p>
      
      <p>“Or not,” Wei Ying says. “That's okay. I use Wen Ning's account so we can just log onto that.”</p>
      
      <p>He notices Lan Zhan's eyebrows knitting together at the mention of Wen Ning's name.</p>
      
      <p>“Something wrong?” Wei Ying asks. Lan Zhan barely reacts to anything, so he's starting to grasp onto <em>any</em> change on his face as a sign. “Do you have an account we can use?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. “Do what you must.”</p>
      
      <p>Strange. His tone is quicker there, like he's forcing out the words... Or Wei Ying is looking into things too deeply.</p>
      
      <p>“Okaaaaay, Lan Zhan, do you have a laptop? Please tell me you have a laptop.”</p>
      
      <p>“Sizhui has one.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying nudges him with his elbow. “What about you?”</p>
      
      <p>With him sat so close to Wei Ying, Lan Zhan's golden eyes are brighter than ever. It never occurred to the teacher before how <em>pretty</em> they are. He's in the middle of admiring them when Lan Zhan speaks.</p>
      
      <p>“I have a typewriter.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying blinks. “Oh. Okay.”</p>
      
      <p>“Use that?”</p>
      
      <p>“You're kidding.”</p>
      
      <p>All Lan Zhan does is frown.</p>
      
      <p>Unable to hold it anymore, Wei Ying throws his head back and laughs. A typewriter?<em> A typewriter?</em> Who even has those anymore?</p>
      
      <p>“Lan Zhan!” Wei Ying wheezes. “What... What is going on with your head? I have never met anyone who thinks you can use Netflix on a typewriter! Please tell me you're joking! You're joking, aren't you? I never thought you'd be the type to make jokes!”</p>
      
      <p>He cracks open one eye, in time to see Lan Zhan throwing him the coldest scowl known to man. Not wanting to push his luck more than he already has, Wei Ying stops laughing.</p>
      
      <p>“Don't look at me like that, Lan Zhan. Okay, okay, let's use Sizhui's laptop instead. Can you get it for me?”</p>
      
      <p>Luckily, Lan Zhan's scowl disappears. He nods, getting up to retrieve his son's laptop. Once he's gone, Wei Ying lets out a few more chuckles at the idea of Lan Zhan attempting to use Netflix on a typewriter.</p>
      
      <p>Huh, come to think of it, he hasn't laughed like this in a while... Part of him feels that he <em>shouldn't</em> be laughing with everything going on in his life, but it really is difficult to think when Lan Zhan is around. There's something about him that makes Wei Ying forget about all his troubles.</p>
      
      <p>In another time, he'd feel guilty about this. Maybe, when he's back at home and all alone, he'll think to this moment and berate himself for being so selfish and carefree.</p>
      
      <p>For now, he doesn't want to dwell too much. His laughter dies down eventually, although the smile on his face is hard to drop. He's glad when Lan Zhan comes back, carrying Sizhui's laptop under one arm.</p>
      
      <p>Because Lan Zhan is clearly not an expert with technology, Wei Ying crawls out of the sofa to connect the TV and the laptop together. He logs into Wen Ning's account, sparing a few seconds to laugh at the fact Wen Ning was watching a documentary about pandas last night.</p>
      
      <p>“This is my favourite movie, Lan Zhan,” Wei Ying says once he's picked something. He returns to his spot next to Lan Zhan. “You'll love it; it's got everything from romance, adventure, humour, <em>everything</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan says nothing, only nodding. The movie starts and music fills the large house, bringing it to life. Wei Ying sways in tune with it, singing along to the lyrics he knows. As expected, Lan Zhan is as emotionless as a spoon.</p>
      
      <p>“Why is he green?” he asks.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying turns back to the screen. Shrek has just appeared, scratching his butt, while All Star by Smash Mouth plays in the background. Lan Zhan makes a displeased noise when Shrek is shown naked, bathing in mud and gargling with it in the next scene. It only gets worse from here. By the time Shrek is farting at the swamp, Lan Zhan looks just about ready to leave. The movie hasn't even been going on for ten minutes yet.</p>
      
      <p>“Stop judging Shrek,” Wei Ying says. “The message of this movie is not to judge others for their appearance. You have to look <em>deeper</em> inside Shrek, Lan Zhan. He has lots and lots of layers—like an onion. Get it?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan gives him a suffering look.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm only teasing. You're too easy to tease.” Wei Ying nudges him with his elbow, pointing back at the screen. “But I mean it when I say it's a good movie. Look, you're going to miss Prince Charming.”</p>
      
      <p>There are no more complaints made about Shrek afterwards. Occasionally, there's a disgusted noise coming from Lan Zhan, but that only happens when Shrek does something unsightly like pick his nose or scratch his butt. Halfway through the movie, Lan Zhan stops making these noises, now used to Shrek's ghastly behaviour.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying doesn't know when it happens. He ends up with his head on Lan Zhan's shoulder and one of Lan Zhan's arms around his waist. After some convincing by a more a daring part of his brain, he grabs Lan Zhan's hand and entwines their fingers together. His fingers are longer than Wei Ying's; calloused, but more graceful. That must come with being a musician.</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan doesn't move, and neither does he. Smiling, Wei Ying squeezes Lan Zhan's hand, so gently that any normal person wouldn't even notice it, wouldn't even care.</p>
      
      <p>His cheeks flush. Lan Zhan squeezes back, almost instantly. Wei Ying remains quiet, mentally screaming at his senses to stop freaking out over something so small. He's thirty-three years old and here he is, swooning over <em>this.</em> He won't bat an eyelash when it comes to having sex with strangers, but he'll blush like some virgin holding Lan Zhan's hand? How is this possible?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying chews his bottom lip. It's hard to focus on the rest of the movie now, not when he's too busy staring at how nicely his hand fits into Lan Zhan's.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng taps his feet against the floor, glaring at the door his nephew is supposed to have gone through ten minutes ago.</p>
      
      <p>“A-Ling, hurry the fuck up or else we'll miss our flight!” Jiang Cheng yells into his apartment.</p>
      
      <p>Right on cue, Jin Ling leaves the bedroom, tugging a gigantic suitcase with him. The suitcase crashes into several of Jiang Cheng's furniture, including a shelf that dangerously sways, knocking off a few books onto the floor. Jin Ling doesn't give a shit though, continuing to barrel through the apartment and whacking everything in sight with that unnecessarily large suitcase. You'd think they were leaving for a year and not just a week.</p>
      
      <p>“The jet belongs to Dad,” Jin Ling grumbles. “It's not going to go off without us, Uncle.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng's eye twitches. “I said hurry the fuck up!”</p>
      
      <p>His nephew grumbles some more but luckily keeps the rest of his sassy remarks to himself. As Jin Ling struggles to get out the apartment, Jiang Cheng looks around the corridor. It's empty now with everyone having gone to work. Too empty.</p>
      
      <p>Unable to help himself, he turns towards Xichen's door.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng narrows his eyes. Even with all the problems he has right now, he hasn't been able to forget the way the librarian reacted yesterday. He hadn't meant to say all of those things to him—he just got <em>angry.</em> As soon as the words left his mouth, Xichen acted as if Jiang Cheng stabbed him through the chest. He left before Jiang Cheng could even think of apologising.</p>
      
      <p>“He's probably at work right now, Uncle,” Jin Ling says, finally emerging from the apartment.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng raises an eyebrow at him.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling nods at Xichen's door. “Lan-guang. He's at work right now, isn't he?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don't give a shit about him. Why are you telling me that?”</p>
      
      <p>Pursing his lips, Jin Ling fiddles with the handle of his suitcase. Jiang Cheng doesn't miss the way he rolls his eyes. The urge to smack him is rising.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, you were looking at his door... I heard you two arguing yesterday so I thought you might want to apologise.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng glares at him, fists clenching. He resists smacking some sense into his nephew and directs all of his frustration into angrily locking his apartment instead.</p>
      
      <p>“Mind your own business!” he snaps. “Why should I apologise when it was his fault for prying in the first place? I told you to hurry up!”</p>
      
      <p>He walks off, not bothering to wait for Jin Ling at all.</p>
      
      <p>“This suitcase is heavy!” Jin Ling complains from behind him. Like the caring uncle he is, Jiang Cheng ignores his struggles and walks faster. That'll teach that brat.</p>
      
      <p>His plans of leaving Jin Ling to catch up to him are thwarted when his phone rings. Jiang Cheng answers it, not bothering to check who's calling him now.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>What</em> is it?” he hisses.</p>
      
      <p>“Good morning to you too.”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan. Now his mood plummets even more. Jiang Cheng takes a deep breath and attempts to calm his voice down.</p>
      
      <p>“Zixuan. How is she?”</p>
      
      <p>He hears a sigh. “Still the same. They're trying to treat her pneumonia but she's getting weaker.”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan already explained everything yesterday. Although A-Jie was on the path to recovery, she caught pneumonia from being in the hospital for so long. To think, before this, she managed to leave her bed a few times and the doctor even said she could leave in a few months if she continued to show positive signs. Why did this have to happen out of nowhere?</p>
      
      <p>“She'll fight through it. She always does,” Jiang Cheng says. The thought of his sister not managing to make it isn't something he's willing to accept. She will make it through this.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you bringing him with you?” Jin Zixuan asks all of a sudden.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng immediately knows who he's talking about. He grips the phone tighter, tempted to end this call already. Behind him, Jin Ling has finally caught up. He pants and leans against the suitcase, complaining under his breath.</p>
      
      <p>“I told you to bring Wei Ying,” Jin Zixuan says when Jiang Cheng doesn't respond. “We talked about this yesterday.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng grits his teeth. “Why does he need to come? We don't need him.”</p>
      
      <p>“You might not, but your sister asked for him. This isn't about you, Jiang Cheng. She wants to see him.”</p>
      
      <p>He hates it whenever Jin Zixuan brings Sis up. He hates it even more that he is right.</p>
      
      <p>It's become normal for him and Wei Ying to fight whenever they see each other. As soon as he sees his face, Jiang Cheng is hit with a multitude of emotions he can't understand; hatred, frustration, grief, and—as much as he hates to admit it—loss. He doesn't want to know why it hurts him that he can never have his old relationship with Wei Ying again, so Jiang Cheng turns to the only emotion he can understand; anger.</p>
      
      <p>He's angry it's turned out this way, and he's angry Wei Ying has done nothing but run away. Does he not care?</p>
      
      <p>Does it matter?</p>
      
      <p><em>I care! I've always cared!</em></p>
      
      <p><em>No, you don't,</em> Jiang Cheng thinks. Wei Ying was just saying that. If he cared, he would have never left, he would have stayed by his side when he was mourning their parents, when he was worried sick about A-Jie, unable to sleep every night at the thought of losing <em>another</em> member of his family. If he cared, Wei Ying would have done <em>something</em> instead of getting drunk to the point that Jiang Cheng barely even knew him anymore.</p>
      
      <p>“It's too late now,” Jiang Cheng says.</p>
      
      <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
      
      <p>“We fought yesterday, okay?”</p>
      
      <p>Again, he hears a sigh coming from Jin Zixuan. It sounds more impatient than the last, and he can imagine the arrogant man glaring from wherever he is back in America.</p>
      
      <p>“It's been over ten years.”</p>
      
      <p>“She's <em>your</em> wife. How can you not hate him?”</p>
      
      <p>“Don't get me wrong. There are days where I wish we never bothered to invite him to the wedding, then maybe she would have...” Jin Zixuan trails off, the frustration in his voice seeping through. “It doesn't matter. She wanted him there, and she wants him here now. You can blame him all you want but he never meant to push her down those stairs.”</p>
      
      <p>“If he had never started drinking at the banquet—”</p>
      
      <p>“I'm not arguing about this with you right now,” Jin Zixuan interrupts. There's an edge to his voice that reminds Jiang Cheng of the times he and Wei Ying used to fight him when they were children. “Same as I'm not letting your stupid war with Wei Ying stop A-Li from seeing him.”</p>
      
      <p>Before he knows it, Jin Zixuan has hung up on him. Jiang Cheng is so shocked at his sudden outburst that he stares wide-eyed at his screen for a few seconds. He lets out a frustrated noise, shoving his phone back into his pocket.</p>
      
      <p>“Fucking bastard!” he mutters.</p>
      
      <p>“Was that my dad?” Jin Ling asks.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes. Fuck him.”</p>
      
      <p>His nephew frowns, standing up straighter. “Why was he calling? Is Mom okay?”</p>
      
      <p>“She's fine, don't worry. Your dad was just being annoying. Come on, let's go. We've wasted enough time.”</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng walks off again. All he wants is to arrive in America and be by his sister's side. He doesn't want to think about Wei Ying. He never knows what to think when it comes to Wei Ying.</p>
      
      <p>His gaze travels outside, squinting at the sunlight. Lan Xichen's voice is stuck in his head; the words he said yesterday has been unable to leave him.</p>
      
      <p><em>Cherish all the time you have with the people you care about.</em></p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng snapped at him for saying that. He didn't like the way his heart agreed with the sentiment, and he hated that, not only did he think of his sister, he also thought of Wei Ying.</p>
      
      <p>Pathetic. Jiang Cheng is so pathetic.</p>
      
      <p>He pushes aside all of these thoughts and leaves the apartment block. Sunlight glares down at him although the chill of the wind bites at his skin. He wraps his coat tighter around himself and waits for Jin Ling to join his side.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan had asked the impossible and told him to bring Wei Ying with them to America. Jiang Cheng can't imagine what it would have been like if he had Wei Ying by his side now. Would they talk? Argue? Would it have been worth it? He refused to ask Wei Ying for obvious reasons, but deep down he knows it's also because he's not ready to properly face him.</p>
      
      <p>Turns out Wei Ying isn't the only one running away after all.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng sighs. He gazes up at the sky, shielding his eyes from the blinding rays. He doesn't know what Wei Ying is doing right now, and he's quick to think he doesn't care. At the end of the day, wherever he is, he isn't by Jiang Cheng's side.</p>
      
      <p>Even after all these years, that thought still manages to jab his chest.</p>
      
      <p><em>It doesn't matter,</em> he thinks.</p>
      
      <p>But it does. And he hates that the most.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying falls asleep halfway through the movie. He must have been more tired than he realised and Lan Zhan is far, far too comfortable. When he opens his eyes again, the TV has been switched off and he's now almost lying on top of the musician, safely wrapped around his arms. Wei Ying lets out a content noise and rubs his eyes, drowsily looking around. He should sit up and untangle himself... later. He'll do that later.</p>
      
      <p>“How... How long was I asleep for?” he asks, yawning.</p>
      
      <p>“Half an hour.” Lan Zhan's voice sounds so nice being this close to him.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying closes his eyes again, listening to the musician's steady pulse. He feels one of Lan Zhan's hands rub his back, tempting him to fall back asleep.</p>
      
      <p>“Only that...? It feels like I've been sleeping all day...”</p>
      
      <p>“Rest some more.”</p>
      
      <p>“Maybe...” Wei Ying yawns. “I'm not crushing you, am I? Should I move?”</p>
      
      <p>“No,” Lan Zhan says. His fingers bury themselves into Wei Ying's hair, pressing him closer to his chest. Wei Ying is only too happy to remain where he is. “Rest.”</p>
      
      <p>With the way Lan Zhan is stroking his hair and rubbing his scalp, Wei Ying really will fall back asleep. He threads his fingers through Wei Ying's strands as if he's glass; every touch, every stroke, is gentle and light. It's nothing like the rush Wei Ying used to be addicted to; that feeling of skin against skin, unknown fingers digging into his waist and leaving bruises by the next morning. No, Lan Zhan chases away the weight in his chest, replacing it with a contentment he hasn't felt in years. As he listens to the gentle lull of the musician's breaths, Wei Ying can't even find the energy to feel guilty about this moment of peace.</p>
      
      <p>He wraps his arms around Lan Zhan's neck and breathes in the scent of sandalwood.</p>
      
      <p>“This is nice, Lan Zhan,” he admits. “I like this.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan's arms tighten around him; not so much that it feels like he's being crushed, but enough for Wei Ying's heart to skip a beat.</p>
      
      <p>He could stay like this forever. He wouldn't mind staying like this forever.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, his phone has other plans. It rings, interrupting the peaceful silence between the two of them. Wei Ying whines, slowly untangling himself from Lan Zhan's welcoming arms and fishing his phone out with a scowl. As soon as he sees who's calling him, the scowl drops, replaced with a million questions racing through his head.</p>
      
      <p>“What is wrong?” Lan Zhan asks.</p>
      
      <p>“Nothing,” Wei Ying says. “Can I take this call?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan nods. Reluctantly, Wei Ying leaves him, rushing off into one of the other rooms.</p>
      
      <p>It's the rabbit room, he realises as he steps inside. The sight of the small rabbits hopping around brings a smile to his lips, one that goes away when he stares back at his phone.</p>
      
      <p>With a deep breath, he answers it.</p>
      
      <p>“Hello?”</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying, Jiang Cheng told me you two had a fight.”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan doesn't even bother with introductions; he goes right into it. It takes a while for Wei Ying to catch up. Jiang Cheng spoke to him? Why would he talk about Wei Ying?</p>
      
      <p>“Did he?”</p>
      
      <p>“I take it you know about A-Li's condition.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying walks further into the room, watching the small bunnies jumping around. He forces himself to think back to his argument with Jiang Cheng.</p>
      
      <p>“He said that she was deteriorating. Is she... Is she okay?”</p>
      
      <p>He hears Jin Zixuan inhaling before he speaks. He sounds tired; isn't it late there in Ohio? Why is he still awake?</p>
      
      <p>“She caught pneumonia at the hospital. The doctors are trying to treat it but she's getting worse by the day.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying has no idea what to say to that. Whenever he thinks of Jiejie, he thinks of her cooking in the kitchen, telling him off for trying to eat the ingredients before she's finished with them. He doesn't think of her laying in a hospital bed, connected to a ventilator, fighting for her life.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm calling you because she wants you here.”</p>
      
      <p>He blinks, not expecting to hear those words at all.</p>
      
      <p>“What?”</p>
      
      <p>“A-Li says she wants to see you,” Jin Zixuan says slowly for him to let that sentence sink in. “She wants to see all of us together.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying's throat suddenly feels dry. “I...”</p>
      
      <p>“Don't tell me that you can't.”</p>
      
      <p>Just like that, Jin Zixuan's voice starts to rise. Old habits die hard and Wei Ying has to clench his fists to stop himself from snapping back.</p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying, stop running away,” he continues. “What are you going to do if she... if she...”</p>
      
      <p>“How am I even going to get there?” Wei Ying asks. He doesn't want Jin Zixuan to finish that sentence.</p>
      
      <p>“I've got plenty of private jets back in Lanling. I can get my men to fly you over here tomorrow.”</p>
      
      <p>So typical of the Jins. If Jin Zixuan is offering him one of his private jets then he must really be desperate to get Wei Ying to come to America.</p>
      
      <p>“Does Jiang Cheng know you want me there?”</p>
      
      <p>“I <em>asked</em> him to tell you.”</p>
      
      <p>A bitter smile spreads onto Wei Ying's lips. “I think he must have forgotten while he was screaming about how much he hated me.”</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan lets out a tired sigh.</p>
      
      <p>“I'll have to think about it,” Wei Ying tells him.</p>
      
      <p>“What the fuck do you mean <em>think</em> about it—”</p>
      
      <p>“I'll call you back later today. This is a lot to take in, okay?”</p>
      
      <p>There's a frustrated scoff coming from the other side. “Wei Ying. This could be your only chance to fix things. If you really love your family so much, you'd do whatever it takes to be there for them.”</p>
      
      <p>As much as Wei Ying wants to hate Jin Zixuan, he's right. Deep down, it's always baffled him how Jin Zixuan manages to juggle his business and visits to Jiejie. It isn't as if he has an easy job either; along with his father, he helps with running their family car company. Mo Xuanyu once told Wei Ying that Jin Zixuan cannot afford a break, not even when he returns back to the country. When he's here, he has to meet with other businessmen, as well as help calculate their shares. On top of that, he still tries to spend as much time as he can with Jin Ling.</p>
      
      <p>It all sounds too much for one person. Yet, here he is, doing just that for the past decade or so.</p>
      
      <p>Meanwhile, Wei Ying has done nothing but avoid reality.</p>
      
      <p>He clutches his head. His headache is returning.</p>
      
      <p>“I'll call you back,” Wei Ying says again. “Just let me think for a bit, please.”</p>
      
      <p>He hangs up, finally releasing the breath he's been holding in. Sighing, Wei Ying squats down to stroke the rabbits gathering by his feet.</p>
      
      <p>Jiejie wants him to go to America... She wants to see him.</p>
      
      <p>Actually going there isn't going to be a problem; Jin Zixuan is offering a free flight, and Wei Ying knows Shen Yuan will understand if he can't go to work for a few days because of Jiejie. Although strict, Shen Yuan has a good heart and has always tried to encourage him along a better path.</p>
      
      <p>The only problem lies with <em>him.</em> Can Wei Ying do it?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying quickly stands up, scaring the rabbits away. He walks back to the living room where Lan Zhan is waiting for him on the sofa, eyes following every step Wei Ying takes.</p>
      
      <p>“What is wrong?” Lan Zhan asks.</p>
      
      <p>Tired, Wei Ying sits back down. He doesn't allow himself to return into Lan Zhan's arms.</p>
      
      <p>“My sister's husband just called. He's asking me to go to America for her tomorrow. I haven't been in America in years...” His eyebrows knit together as he's hit with unpleasant memories. “Last time I was there, Lan Zhan, I... I didn't have a good time.”</p>
      
      <p>He clutches his head, willing the images of his past to leave him alone. No matter how much he tries, he sees the dark streets he frequented, the clubs that stank of sweat and sex. He sees the hospital Jiejie is in, the looming entrance he ran away from.</p>
      
      <p>“I can't say no to Jiejie,” Wei Ying mutters.</p>
      
      <p>“Then go,” Lan Zhan says.</p>
      
      <p>Easier said than done.</p>
      
      <p>His time in America was when his self worth hit rock bottom. Wei Ying stopped caring about anything else and only sought out to distract himself with alcohol and sex. Thinking back to it now, he hates that side to him, and he hates how much time he's wasted because of it. He'll never return to that lifestyle again, but the thought of being back <em>there</em> in those same streets, seeing all the places he stumbled in drunk, hooking arms with some stranger whose face he'll forget the next morning... The thought makes him sick.</p>
      
      <p>Seeing Jiejie again, when he's changed so much since the last time he was with her, also makes him sick. Will she even recognise him?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying looks up, meeting Lan Zhan's golden eyes.</p>
      
      <p>“I'm scared,” he admits. “I don't know how to face her.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan's lips part. He says nothing at first and it's even more difficult to guess what sort of emotion is playing on his face. The seconds pass and, still, there is silence. Lan Zhan's hand reaches for his, squeezing slightly.</p>
      
      <p>“You love your sister,” he says softly. “If you love someone, you... try to stay with them as much as you can.”</p>
      
      <p><em>But what if my love has only ever given everyone pain?</em></p>
      
      <p>His parents were killed, stolen from his life when he was too young to even understand the concept of death. Every single day of living with the Jiangs was a constant reminder that Aunt Yu hated him, that he ruined their family just by being there. And she was right; he'd torn apart Jiang Cheng's family until there's now nothing but shreds to piece it back together.</p>
      
      <p>How can he face them? How can he be sure he won't ruin anything else?</p>
      
      <p>“Will you be going alone?” Lan Zhan asks. His thumb strokes the back of Wei Ying's hand.</p>
      
      <p>“I suppose I'll have to,” Wei Ying says.</p>
      
      <p>“I will go with you.”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying's eyes widen. “Why would you do that?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan looks down at their entwined hands. “So you will not be alone.”</p>
      
      <p>Why...? Wei Ying can't understand why Lan Zhan would go to such lengths for someone like him. Is he so nice, or is Wei Ying so pathetic?</p>
      
      <p>“Lan Zhan, do you think I'll start drinking again if I'm left alone? Don't worry, I've learnt my lesson. My head is killing me right now, I'm in no rush to drink again.”</p>
      
      <p>He makes a move to pull his hand away but Lan Zhan only squeezes it. Shocked, Wei Ying stays still, searching the musician's face for any answers. He finds none; all he sees are burning golden eyes.</p>
      
      <p>“Not that. If you are scared... It will help if someone is supporting you.”</p>
      
      <p>“You don't need to do that. Thank you for the offer, but I've troubled you enough."</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. “No trouble.”</p>
      
      <p>He still won't let go. Why is he so insistent on staying?</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying has gotten used to being alone. His fear of hurting those he loved has isolated him from others, only choosing to remain at a distance. It's been so many years... He thought he could stay like this; that he'd be happy by himself as long as he didn't drag anyone down with him. He's fine with staying in his rundown apartment, living a life that provided him nothing but repetitive days and a grey future. He's long stopped asking for anything, or anyone else.</p>
      
      <p>It's always been like this, he thinks.</p>
      
      <p><em>He stands, surrounded by flames and corpses, listening to the screams demanding for his head. There's no one else left and he's too tired to care. Grief claws at his heart; the unbearable weight that he's truly alone, that everyone's gone because of him. There's no one left in this world who will mourn him when he is finally dead.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>The flames rise higher. He hears the approaching army coming to end his life, led by the very man he once thought was his brother.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>He smiles. It's all so fitting. He deserves this.</em></p>
      
      <p>“Wei Ying?”</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying blinks, shivering. Lan Zhan squeezes his hand again, reminding him he is here. The panic that threatens to bubble inside him dies down; Lan Zhan's presence is too calming—even with the strange flashbacks he receives out of nowhere.</p>
      
      <p>Are they flashbacks? Or hallucinations?</p>
      
      <p>He wants to tell Lan Zhan about it but this is all too much for one day. As if all energy drains out of him, Wei Ying falls forward into Lan Zhan's chest, resting his head on his shoulder. He closes his eyes, sighing.</p>
      
      <p>“I will go with you,” Lan Zhan says again.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying can't bring himself to deny him anymore.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you sure? What about Sizhui? And your job?”</p>
      
      <p>“My brother can look after him and I can reschedule any classes I may miss.”</p>
      
      <p>“Are you really, <em>really</em> sure?”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan tucks his hair behind his ear, smoothing down the strands that refuse to stay in place. “Wei Ying, I would not offer if I was unsure.”</p>
      
      <p>There is a significant change in the pace of Lan Zhan's heartbeat. It's nice; even with his expressions rarely shown, it makes Wei Ying happy to know he is still human. Wei Ying's own pulse is racing too; at the thought of actually accepting Jin Zixuan's offer, and at the thought that Lan Zhan doesn't want him to be alone.</p>
      
      <p>“Okay,” he says, at last.</p>
      
      <p>He sits up, smiling at the surprise now evident in Lan Zhan's eyes.</p>
      
      <p>“I'll have to ask Jin Zixuan first... but okay.”</p>
      
      <p>Lan Zhan nods.</p>
      
      <p>Nauseous with fear and anxiety, Wei Ying forces himself to stand. He leaves the room, playing the words he'll say to Jin Zixuan over and over in his head. He'll see Jiejie again. He'll go to America and he'll see her. He'll apologise and... and...</p>
      
      <p>He's not sure. He doesn't know what he's going to do.</p>
      
      <p>But, surely, this is better than doing nothing.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying has no idea what will happen in the future; all he knows is that he is tired of everyday being the same disappointment. Seeing Jiejie again is the first step. He will worry about everything else when the time comes.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Wangji watches as Wei Ying leaves to call Jin Zixuan. He did not expect Wei Ying to agree to his offer; over the years and in this lifetime, Wei Ying has been insistent that he wishes to remain alone. He has always been eager to shoulder the burden of others, thinking his heart is strong enough for this lonely path. Wangji can do nothing but follow him, stepping in to catch Wei Ying whenever he falls.</p>
      
      <p>He looks down at his hand, still feeling the ghost of Wei Ying's touch. Around him, his home is enveloped in the scent of lotus flowers and mint. It has only been a few hours and, already, Wei Ying has left an imprint he will never be able to forget. Wangji takes a deep breath, committing everything to memory.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying told him his sister is in America. Jiang Yanli has managed to survive death in this lifetime, just barely. Wangji is not sure if she has much time left, though he knows for certain that Wei Ying's state will only deteriorate if he were to lose his sister. Jiang Yanli had been the catalyst that caused Wei Ying to finally snap in his previous life. After that, he destroyed himself, ignoring all of Wangji's desperate pleas.</p>
      
      <p>Blue energy gathers at Wangji's fingertips, dancing along his jade skin. It is cool to the touch, crackling into the air like fine dust. It dissipates now, unseen to the human eye; Wangji can still feel its energy around him, the familiar warmth of life it has gathered for all these endless years.</p>
      
      <p>If Jiang Yanli dies, history will be repeated. Wei Ying will destroy himself once again.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji will not lose him for a second time. He cannot.</p>
      
      <p>The sound of footsteps alert him. He closes his fist and all of the spirit energy dancing around him fades into nothing.</p>
      
      <p>“It's sorted then,” Wei Ying says. “We're going to Ohio tomorrow.”</p>
      
      <p>Wangji nods, standing up. He meets Wei Ying before he reaches the sofa, admiring the small smile now playing on his lips. It is nice to see him smiling again. While it is nothing like the large grins Wei Ying used to tease Wangji with as a teenager, these fleeting smiles he has given today are enough to remind him why he fell in love in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying opens his mouth, pausing for a long while. He looks like he is struggling to find something to say; his eyes flicker to the ceiling, nibbling at his bottom lip in thought. Wangji watches him, endeared, memorising every emotion that animates his face.</p>
      
      <p>“Ah, I want to thank you, Lan Zhan...” Wei Ying says. The smile on his face widens, although it is shy. Wangji has never seen Wei Ying like this before.</p>
      
      <p>“You do not have to thank me,” Wangji assures.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head, releasing an exaggerated sigh. He places his hands on Wangji's shoulders and quickly leans in. Wangji's heart stops at the feeling of soft lips pressing against his cheek.</p>
      
      <p>It is over too soon. Wei Ying pulls back and there is a flush on his own cheeks, a nervous laugh that escapes him. Frozen on the spot, Wangji has to summon every ounce of self control he has to stop himself from grabbing Wei Ying and kissing him senseless.</p>
      
      <p>“Shrek,” Wei Ying says out of nowhere, avoiding his gaze.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji blinks. “Shrek?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, we still have three movies of Shrek to go through.”</p>
      
      <p>It is now Wangji's turn to shake his head. Amused, he watches Wei Ying diving back onto the sofa, grabbing the remote. He pats the space next to him with a grin and Wangji does not hesitate to join his side, pulling him to his chest again.</p>
      
      <p>Although there is a fire inside him that burns only for this man, Wangji is willing to wait. He has waited over two thousand years already; he will wait a thousand more if he has to, just as long as Wei Ying is happy.</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, that does not mean he approves of Wei Ying's choice in entertainment. Wangji suffers through an entire afternoon of watching this green oaf, with only the sound of Wei Ying's laughter to spur him on to finish the entire saga.</p>
