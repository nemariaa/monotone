      <p>Wangji drives to Wei Ying's apartment as quickly as he can. It is almost midnight and the streets are eerily quiet, but his thoughts are an unending chaos. Wei Ying texted him. Wei Ying texted him and asked if they could talk. Part of Wangji is relieved that he is not running away, although the other part is already fearing what their confrontation will lead to.</p>

      <p>He will have to tell Wei Ying everything. There is no avoiding it now.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying remembers... To what extent, Wangji does not know—but Wei Ying is aware of <em>something</em>, and it is not enough for him to leave. Yet. The fact that he has asked to personally speak to Wangji should be a relief.</p>

      <p>It should be. Instead, Wangji feels as if something has gripped his heart and stopped it from beating ever since.</p>

      <p>As soon as he arrives outside the apartment block, he is not surprised to find the security guard asleep by the entrance. The Burial Complex is such an old building that it has not yet installed the same technology as his brother's apartment. Wangji remembers that a card is required to enter Xichen's apartment, but Wei Ying's is only an entrance guarded by a man—who is usually always asleep.</p>

      <p>He narrows his eyes at the guard as he walks past, entering the building. He will worry about the lack of security for these apartments another time. For now, he quickly makes his way for Wei Ying's room.</p>

      <p>It is almost midnight. The corridors are dark, empty, as if they are abandoned. No one is awake here. He is the only one ghosting through this place, searching for the room that Wei Ying resides in. Wangji quickens his steps as soon as he sees door thirty-three. Wei Ying is there, waiting.</p>

      <p>He stops right in front of it. It is only now that he notices the door is already open.</p>

      <p>Frowning, Wangji gently knocks.</p>

      <p>There is no response.</p>

      <p>His frown deepens.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying?” he calls, slowly opening the door. It is quiet, as quiet as the whole corridor and the slumbering evening. When he looks inside, there is no one in the living room. Wei Ying is nowhere to be seen.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying?” Wangji calls again, louder. “It is me.”</p>

      <p>Silence. There is nothing but the gradual increase of his own pulse.</p>

      <p>It is not like Wei Ying to invite him here, only to not greet him. Wangji looks around the living room, still listening. The television is off. Wei Ying's phone is on the floor, right next to the table.</p>

      <p>Something is not right. The table is skewed, almost as if it has been pushed aside. Wei Ying would not leave his door open, especially if he is not inside his apartment. Where is he?</p>

      <p>Wangji turns around, scanning his surroundings. He could search the other rooms—perhaps Wei Ying is just asleep, unaware that he has left his door open. Perhaps he is over-thinking. Perhaps.</p>

      <p>Before he can take a step towards Wei Ying's bedroom, he spots a speck of colour in corner of his eyes. Red.</p>

      <p>There, on the door behind him, is a stain of crimson.</p>

      <p>Blood.</p>

      <p>Wangji freezes. His eyes are fixed on the crimson, so bright against the wood. <em>Blood.</em></p>

      <p><em>Wei Ying.</em></p>

      <p>Everything rushes. He is sprinting to the other rooms, slamming each door open and calling for him. There is nothing; no sound, no Wei Ying inside to tell him that everything is fine. The whole apartment is empty. Wei Ying is not here. Where is he? What has happened? <em>Where is he?</em></p>

      <p>In the back of his mind, he remembers what his brother said. Earlier tonight, he had been attacked by a group of unknown men.</p>

      <p>Could it be...?</p>

      <p>Fear grasps him, churning his guts until he feels sick. He does not know what is happening, or what he should do. Wangji clutches his head, trying to think.</p>

      <p>He can call the police—but what will they do? Wei Ying is in danger and the thought of trusting strangers with his life does not give him any comfort. The police are only human. Wangji will find Wei Ying himself. He must.</p>

      <p>What is happening? Wangji struggles to piece everything together. This week, Wei Ying has been acting strange, often snapping or avoiding him entirely. He found Suibian and the portrait in Wangji's attic, but now he has somehow been taken—by who exactly? And why?</p>

      <p>He is wasting time trying to find answers. Wangji rushes out of the apartment, reaching for his phone. His brother is the only person he can turn to for help.</p>

      <p>Xichen answers immediately. Wangji returns to his car and starts the engine, fumbling for the wheel as his heart pounds louder than his brother's voice.</p>

      <p>“Brother, I need your help,” he says. “I'm coming to your apartment.”</p>

      <p>There is a pause, and then: “Hang on, I'll be down shortly.”</p>

      <p>They hang up. It is times like this that Wangji is grateful his brother can read him so easily, even when they are not face to face. He drives as fast as he can, eyes fixed on the road but his thoughts dashing around in circles. His mind is spiralling downwards and all he can think of is that someone has taken Wei Ying. Someone has taken Wei Ying, and Wangji does not know who or why. Wei Ying is in danger. He was too late. He wasn't there to protect him. He was too late <em>again.</em></p>

      <p>Wangji grips the car wheel. <em>No. </em>He will find Wei Ying. No matter what, he will find him. He must.</p>

      <p>His brother is already waiting in the car park when he arrives. Wangji rushes out of the car. The confusion and concern on his brother's face does little to comfort him.</p>

      <p>“Brother, he's gone,” he says. <em>He's gone.</em></p>

      <p>Xichen grasps his shoulder. “Wangji, what's wrong?”</p>

      <p><em>Everything</em>. Everything has gone wrong.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying. He knows. He found Suibian and the portrait.”</p>

      <p>“He's ran away?”</p>

      <p>He shakes his head. “No—I... I don't know. His apartment... There was blood. Someone took him.”</p>

      <p>Someone must have taken him. Wei Ying asked to meet. He would not disappear all of a sudden. There would not be blood in his apartment unless something occurred. It is the only explanation.</p>

      <p>His brother frowns. The grip he has on his shoulder loosens. “Are you sure?”</p>

      <p>“I would not lie about this.”</p>

      <p>Letting him go, Xichen sighs. “I know.”</p>

      <p>“I need to find him, but I don't—I don't know where. I don't know how.”</p>

      <p>Why would anyone want to take Wei Ying? And why? As far as Wangji knows, Wei Ying has not done anything in this life to anger someone to this extent. If Wangji knew <em>who</em>, he could start from there and find them.</p>

      <p>Xichen holds his chin in thought. “The gang attacks... But why would they target Wei Wuxian?”</p>

      <p>His brother had said the gang attacks were random, that they took place in the streets. There were no patterns to them; only that they were mindless and scattered throughout the months. Even if they are the ones responsible for this, then what is so special about Wei Ying that they personally sought him? What has Wei Ying done?</p>

      <p>All of these questions are infuriating. It is as if the answer is there, in front of his eyes, but he cannot make sense of all these pieces laid out before him. He thinks back to every conversation with Wei Ying; every smile and laugh he has graced Wangji with. They have spent numerous nights talking, nestled in each other's arms as Wei Ying tells him stories his parents once shared with him as a child.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying seldom told stories about his own life. Wangji was willing to wait. He did not want to force Wei Ying to share anything that would only cause him pain.</p>

      <p>But there is something that Wei Ying <em>did</em> share. It was during their date in America. They were in the park, and Wei Ying trusted Wangji enough to tell him about the death of his parents.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying's parents were killed by intruders,” he quietly says.</p>

      <p>Xichen's eyebrows furrow. “What do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“When he was six... He said his parents were murdered in their own home. The intruders were never caught.”</p>

      <p>It could mean nothing. Wangji does not know the details behind the death of Wei Ying's parents, but the circumstances surrounding it are too suspicious to disregard. It could be a coincidence, of course, and the people who killed Wei Ying's parents are not the same as those who took him—but—</p>

      <p>Wangji shakes his head, frustrated at himself. “I must find him,” he says.</p>

      <p>He turns around. His brother grabs his arm before he can take a single step.</p>

      <p>“Wangji, wait! Where are you going?”</p>

      <p>He does not know. He does not know where he is supposed to go, or where he should <em>start</em>. All he knows is that Wei Ying is out there and he must find him. He cannot waste time here, asking questions that no one will answer.</p>

      <p>“I must find Wei Ying,” he says again.</p>

      <p>The grip on his arm tightens. Xichen's face reminds him of a time he thought he had forgotten. Thousands and thousands of years ago; on that same day his brother told him Wei Ying had died. Wangji refused to listen to reason. No matter how much his brother tried to stop him, he left Gusu and rushed to the Burial Mound, in search of Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>He cannot let that happen again. Wangji grits his teeth and tries to snatch his arm away.</p>

      <p>Still, Xichen does not let go. “Do you know where he is?” he demands. “We can't even be sure who took him!”</p>

      <p>He hates the reasoning his brother can conjure at a time like this. When it comes to Wei Ying, all ounce of common sense abandons Wangji. He does not care for anything else.</p>

      <p>“I cannot lose him again,” he says. His voice wavers and shakes. It takes all of his strength to compose what little sanity he has left. “Brother, I can't.”</p>

      <p>“Lose who?”</p>

      <p>Another voice joins them. Wangji stiffens, his eyes flickering over his brother's shoulder. He did not notice the car that parked just now, nor the man that stepped out. He clenches his fists, met with steel blue eyes that only narrow back at him.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng walks closer, frowning at both brothers. Upon seeing him, Xichen lets go of Wangji and lets out a sigh that sounds tired.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng ignores him. He nods his head at Wangji. “I heard you talking about Wei Ying. What's happened?”</p>

      <p>Wangji does not answer. He stares at his brother, gauging his reaction. Like him, Xichen is silent. His gaze is fixed on the ground, as if he is trying his best not to look at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>“I asked you a question! What's happened to Wei Ying?” Jiang Cheng demands. In less than a second, his voice rises and echoes through this car park. Wangji does not miss the way his brother winces.</p>

      <p>Like in their previous life, Wei Ying's relationship with his adopted brother is strained. Wangji is reluctant to tell Jiang Cheng anything. He has never forgotten that it was him who led the siege to kill Wei Ying. Afterwards, he dedicated his whole life hunting down demonic cultivators, letting his hatred consume him until he was nothing more.</p>

      <p>Wangji does not trust Jiang Cheng. He never has.</p>

      <p>As if sensing his thoughts, Xichen looks up and lays a hand on his shoulder. “Wangji, it's okay. He can help.” Sighing, Xichen faces Jiang Cheng. “We believe he's been taken.”</p>

      <p>The scowl on Jiang Cheng's face deepens. His blue eyes are bright, piercing. “What do you <em>mean</em> taken?”</p>

      <p>Wangji takes one look at him and casts aside his grudges. He does not know what Jiang Cheng is like in this life. If his brother trusts him, then that is enough. He cannot waste time now.</p>

      <p>“He called me asking to meet with him tonight,” Wangji answers. “When I arrived, he was not there... There were signs of struggle in his apartment. And blood.”</p>

      <p>He expects Jiang Cheng to demand more answers, perhaps accuse him of lying. However, all he does is take a shuddering breath, staggering back.</p>

      <p>“We need to tell Chief Nie,” he says. Within seconds, he is running back to his car. Xichen trails after him, sparing a look over his shoulder to beckon for Wangji.</p>

      <p>Not knowing what else is left for him to do, Wangji follows them.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>They follow Jiang Cheng into the police station. He is like a storm; he slams open doors and leads the two brothers deeper into the station, ignoring the other officers that demand to know what he's doing. It has been too long since Wangji has been here. He recalls one of his first meetings with Wei Ying ended with them having to go to the police station in order to bail Xichen out... That feels like a different lifetime ago now.</p>

      <p>“You're back,” one of the officers says to Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng barely regards him. He scans the station with a glare. “Where's the chief? Is he still here? I need to talk to him.”</p>

      <p>The officer points down one of the corridors. “He's talking with the suspect now.”</p>

      <p>“Where?”</p>

      <p>“They locked him up in the cells to be safe. The suspect is—”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng does not wait for him to finish his sentence. He runs down the corridor, followed by Wangji and Xichen. Despite the confused stares from the other officers, they do not dare stop them, not when Jiang Cheng looks as if he will destroy anyone should they attempt to do so.</p>

      <p>Wangji catches sight of a clock as they run past. He stops for a second. It is almost twelve thirty. They are losing time. He runs faster.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng barges into a room. Inside, Nie Mingjue is standing in front of a door, the glare on his face enough to rival that of Jiang Cheng's. He jerks back at the sudden intrusion, eyes flickering between all three of them who have just entered. This room is small and claustrophobic; the walls are a dreary grey and it is empty, save for a door and a lone chair beside it. Wangji guesses that the door leads to a cell.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng! Why are you back?” Nie Mingjue demands. “Who told you that you could come in here?! And why are they here?”</p>

      <p>“There's been another attack,” Jiang Cheng answers. It is enough for all of the questions.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue's glare recedes. Behind him, Wangji sees his brother slowly close the door, locking all of them into the silence of this small room. There is a clock on the wall that ticks too, too loud. With every second that passes, Wangji thinks about Wei Ying; alone, in danger.</p>

      <p>“Another attack? On who?” Nie Mingjue asks.</p>

      <p>“My brother. Wei Ying.”</p>

      <p>Just then, a sudden laugh interrupts Jiang Cheng's voice. It comes from inside the cells and echoes through, mocking Wangji the more it gets louder and louder. He clenches his knuckles until they are bone white, trying to see who is inside through the small window of the door.</p>

      <p>It is a young man, perhaps no older than twenty. His hair is tied back into a ponytail and he lounges back on the bed with no care in the world, still laughing.</p>

      <p><em>Xue Yang, </em>he remembers. Xue Yang had been the suspect the police took in for questioning.</p>

      <p>“They finally did it, huh?” Xue Yang says. His laughter subsides into smirks. The amusement in his eyes is enough to stir an anger inside Wangji that surprises even himself. He digs his fingers into his palms, resisting the urge to lunge at the door and demand answers. It does not help that he can see the sheer amusement in Xue Yang's eyes, even from inside that cell.</p>

      <p>He knows something. He knows something that Wangji does not.</p>

      <p>“They?” Wangji repeats.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue turns to the door as well, slamming a fist on the metal surface. “Explain yourself!” he yells.</p>

      <p>The man's temper does nothing to affect Xue Yang. He lies back, folding his arms behind his head. More seconds are wasted as he refuses to answer the question, only humming a meaningless song into the air.</p>

      <p>Now, Jiang Cheng is glowering at the door too. “What has Wei Ying got to do with this gang? What's going on!”</p>

      <p>Xue Yang shrugs. “Why are you asking me? I'm only following orders.”</p>

      <p>Xichen sighs. “From who?”</p>

      <p>More silence. Xue Yang sits up and there is a glimmer of a smile on his lips. This is all a game to him, a joke, and all three of them are playing right into his hands. Wangji hates how useless he feels, knowing that Xue Yang could have all of the answers he needs to find Wei Ying, and yet all he can do now is <em>wait.</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Who</em> is your leader? Who has ordered you to carry out these attacks?” Xichen asks again.</p>

      <p>Xue Yang smirks. “Wen Ruohan.”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue is pounding his fist once again at the door. “That bastard!” he roars. Each slam of his fists shakes the clock on the wall. “<em>He's</em> the one in charge of these attacks?”</p>

      <p>Before anyone can answer him, Nie Mingjue stiffens. He stands up straighter, letting go of the door as if he has just realised something.</p>

      <p>“Huaisang's with him right now. They have their awards show later today.”</p>

      <p>Again, Xue Yang laughs. “Why do you think Wen Ruohan's been so keen to work with your brother?”</p>

      <p>In an instant, Nie Mingjue lunges at the door, shouting a string of curses that could wake the night. Xichen pushes past Wangji in order to hold onto the enraged man. It takes a while for Nie Mingjue to stop struggling. He shrugs off Xichen with a displeased grunt.</p>

      <p>“What could Wen Ruohan benefit from this?” Xichen asks. His voice is quiet, calm, compared to everyone else. “What sort of man is Wen Ruohan?”</p>

      <p>“He's always been around,” Nie Mingjue says. “With the amount of money he has, he was prominent with celebrities and all that. My father was suspicious about where he got all his money from... but he died before he could question him.”</p>

      <p>“You have never spoken with Wen Ruohan? Or given him any reason to target you?”</p>

      <p>“Target me? Are you saying he's using Huaisang to get to <em>me? </em>Do you know something?”</p>

      <p>He demands the last question but receives no answer from Xichen. Impatient, he turns to Jiang Cheng who swiftly avoids his gaze. No one says a word. The tension in this room is stifling.</p>

      <p><em>Wen Ruohan, </em>Wangji thinks. <em>Wen Ruohan is behind the attacks. </em>It should not be a surprise, considering how he was in the past—but what are his reasons now? Is life so predictable that its villains refuse to change?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying has not changed. His life may be different now, but he is still the same Wei Ying that Wangji fell in love with thousands and thousands of years ago. The same face, and the same personality—just without the memories of his past life.</p>

      <p><em>Or... </em>Wangji frowns. He looks down at the floor, seeing another sight entirely. Wei Ying has shown signs that he <em>may</em> have some memories from his past life. Wangji does not know how much he remembers, but he is certain that Wei Ying's memories from before are not all forgotten. Some part of him, deep down, <em>knows.</em></p>

      <p>If Wei Ying is capable of remembering then... is it not the same for others too? He glances back up. His gaze flickers between Nie Mingjue and Jiang Cheng, wondering if they have had glimpses into their past lives. Beside them, his brother is also staring into space.</p>

      <p>Wangji remembers their conversation a couple of hours ago. Tonight has been too long. Wei Ying is not the only person who was attacked; his brother was attacked too, was he not?</p>

      <p><em>Tonight</em>. Xichen was attacked tonight, by the same gang that Wen Ruohan is supposedly the leader of.</p>

      <p>Slowly, Wangji sees a piece of a puzzle that he has not considered yet. He takes a deep breath.</p>

      <p>“Brother...” he calls. Xichen looks up, raising an eyebrow at him. “You said you saw Wen Ruohan earlier.”</p>

      <p>“Yes?”</p>

      <p>“Coincidentally, you were attacked on the same night by the gang.”</p>

      <p>Xichen's eyes widen.</p>

      <p>If Wen Ruohan is indeed the one orchestrating these attacks, then what are his reasons for attacking his brother—after he saw him for the first time? Xichen, as far as Wangji knows, had never met <em>this</em> Wen Ruohan before. Wen Ruohan had no reason to target him. Not in this lifetime. Not if he did not remember anything.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng turns to Xichen. “Are you saying Wen Ruohan was targetting <em>you?</em>”</p>

      <p>His brother does not answer. He is still staring at Wangji. Nothing needs to be said between them; Wangji knows he fully understands what he is trying to suggest. Xichen may be an expert at reading his thoughts, but Wangji thinks he is also good at understanding the way his brother thinks. The original Wen Ruohan died because of the Venerated Triad. Everyone, across the whole cultivational world, knew the extent of Wen Ruohan's pride and ruthlessness.</p>

      <p>If he is still the same, and if he remembers, there is no doubt that he would seek out those responsible for his past death. Xichen, Nie Mingjue, and Jin Guangyao had been part of the Venerated Triad. While it was Jin Guangyao that ultimately killed Wen Ruohan, the three of them were the prominent figures in the campaign that finally put an end to the Wens.</p>

      <p>“What the <em>fuck</em> is going on?!” Nie Mingjue demands.</p>

      <p>Xichen still does not look up. “Meng Yao works for Wen Ruohan, doesn't he?” He continues into the silence, his words slow and cautious. “You've been telling Meng Yao about your investigation all this time.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng breathes out, realising something. “Meng Yao was there when Xiao Xingchen was attacked.”</p>

      <p>The rage in Nie Mingjue's eyes is more contained, as if he is struggling to put the pieces together. His fists gradually tighten into knuckles and he hisses under his breath, shaking his head.</p>

      <p>“That <em>bastard. </em>Are you telling me he's behind this as well? He's been trying to get close to Huaisang and me all this time!”</p>

      <p>Xichen's gaze drops to the floor. “Or he could be innocent.”</p>

      <p>Wangji frowns.</p>

      <p>“Meng Yao idolises Wen Ruohan. He may not even be aware his own manager is the leader behind these attacks—”</p>

      <p>“<em>Brother!” </em>Wangji interrupts. His brother had been fooled by Jin Guangyao before—surely he does not intend to make the same mistake? At his voice, Xichen flinches and looks up at him, a silent apology laid out in his eyes. Kindness is his brother's biggest trait, and also his biggest flaw. He sees the good in everyone and allows it to blind him to their deceit.</p>

      <p>“I know,” Xichen mumbles. “Or... I... I don't know.” He shakes his head, avoiding Wangji's gaze.</p>

      <p>Wangji checks the time again. Almost quarter to one.</p>

      <p>None of this answers the question of where Wei Ying could be. Even if Wen Ruohan remembers, would he go to the extent of abducting Wei Ying as well? It is possible, but...</p>

      <p>“Does Wen Ruohan have any children?” Wangji quietly asks.</p>

      <p>“Yes,” Nie Mingjue answers. “Two sons; Wen Chao and Wen Xu.”</p>

      <p><em>Wen Chao.</em></p>

      <p>If there is anyone who wishes to harm Wei Ying, it would be Wen Chao.</p>

      <p>No matter how much Wangji tries to breathe, his chest is heavy with fear and dread. He takes a step towards his brother.</p>

      <p>“Brother, they remember,” he says. “They all know.”</p>

      <p>The Wens have taken Wei Ying. They could have also been behind the death of his parents—but if so, why did they wait until <em>now</em> to take him? Did they want to wait until he was older?</p>

      <p>“They remember <em>what? </em>Explain yourselves! Do you know something that we don't?!”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue's voice is nothing but distant noise. Wangji faces Xue Yang's cell door, gripping its handle. Inside, Xue Yang looks up at him, bored.</p>

      <p>“Where is Wen Ruohan? Will Wen Chao be with him?” Wangji asks, hating the empty expression in Xue Yang's eyes. Xue Yang has always had no regard for human life. Even back then, he ruthlessly killed an entire sect and laughed about it. Relying on him for answers is a gamble. The words that come out of him could may well be a trap.</p>

      <p>But this is the only link Wangji has to Wei Ying. If it is a trap, then so be it. He will find Wei Ying, even at the cost of his own life.</p>

      <p>He grips the door tighter. Xue Yang's only response to his questions is an infuriating grin. “Where. Is. He.”</p>

      <p>Yawning, Xue Yang falls back on the bed and kicks his feet in the air. “The Nightless City,” he says.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng frowns. “That casino in Qishan?”</p>

      <p>Xue Yang yawns for the second time. Wangji does not wait for him to answer again. He spins around and heads for the exit.</p>

      <p>A hand curls around his arm, pulling him back.</p>

      <p>“Wangji, <em>wait! </em>Do you intend to go by <em>yourself?</em>” Xichen snaps. His fingers dig into Wangji's arm when he tries to pull away, glaring at the exit in front of him.</p>

      <p>“I need to find him,” Wangji says. He turns to face Xichen, meeting dark eyes that are just as stubborn as his.</p>

      <p>Xichen shakes his head. “I know—but just wait!”</p>

      <p>“I <em>must</em> find him.”</p>

      <p>For all of the years they've existed, the two brothers have always guarded each other's back. In a world that no longer understood immortality, there was no one else to protect them but each other. Neither enjoyed the eternal cycle of life; watching their loved ones die again, and again, and again, waiting for an end that never came. They rarely talked about their feelings regarding their lives, but Wangji knew his brother was just as lonely as him. They were both lost in a world they had lived in for far, far too long.</p>

      <p>And still, they lived, because it was all they could do. They had lost too much, but they refused to lose each other.</p>

      <p>That was then, and this is now. Wangji knows his brother will do everything in his power to try and stop him from doing anything reckless—but this is now. This is now, and this is <em>Wei Ying</em>. Nothing else matters in comparison.</p>

      <p>As always, his brother reads every thought that crosses his mind. Xichen closes his eyes and sighs, tired. “I understand that finding him is urgent but—”</p>

      <p>“I will <em>not</em> lose him again. I can't.”</p>

      <p>“Don't be reckless. We need to think about things!”</p>

      <p>Wangji attempts to snatch his arm away for the second time. His brother's grip is strong, but he slips enough for Wangji to free himself.</p>

      <p>“We are losing time. I <em>need </em>to find Wei Ying.”</p>

      <p>Xichen surges forward and clings onto him again.</p>

      <p>“<em>Brother,” </em>Wangji says through gritted teeth.<em> “</em>Do not stop me.”</p>

      <p>In the corner of his eyes, he sees Jiang Cheng and Nie Mingjue quietly watching their exchange. They are confused, and rightfully so, waiting for the two brothers to make sense of their conversation. Wangji will not waste his time explaining himself to them; he has the answers that he needs. Finding Wei Ying is the only thing left to do.</p>

      <p>“We don't know what Wen Ruohan is capable of!” Xichen tells him. “You can't go by yourself.”</p>

      <p>“He is only human,” Wangji says. Even if Xue Yang is lying, he <em>will</em> find a way. He will not give up until Wei Ying is safe.</p>

      <p>“And <em>what? </em>If you do find him, do you intend to storm in? What will you do if you're caught? What then?”</p>

      <p>Wangji can only shake his head. “I cannot lose Wei Ying again,” he says again. Nothing else matters. He has waited almost three thousand years to see a glimpse of Wei Ying's face. He will not—<em>cannot—</em>lose him again.</p>

      <p>“What are you two talking about?” Nie Mingjue snaps. “I've had enough of this. What do you know? You two are hiding something!”</p>

      <p>The two brothers fall silent. They exchange glances, searching the other's face for a sign of what they should do. Xichen's grip on his arm loosens, but for once Wangji does not move. There is something in his brother's eyes that stops him.</p>

      <p><em>I am beginning to think we have lived for far too long, Wangji</em>, his brother had said earlier tonight. <em>It's impossible for us to keep on living like this.</em></p>

      <p>But what is there left for them? How else should they live?</p>

      <p>Xichen lets go of him. He turns to Nie Mingjue.</p>

      <p>“My brother and I are immortal,” he says. “We have been alive for almost three thousand years.”</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes widen. The shock of what he has just said out loud stops him from grabbing his brother and asking why, <em>why—</em></p>

      <p>“What the fuck are you talking about? Is this a fucking <em>joke</em> to you?” Nie Mingjue stalks towards Xichen, shaking. Xichen stands his ground and does not flinch from his gaze.</p>

      <p>Wangji quickly scans the room. There are no cameras here where they are, but he does not doubt there is one in Xue Yang's cell in order to monitor him. His brother is risking everything they have lived for in this precise moment.</p>

      <p>“Ask Jiang Cheng,” Xichen says, motioning towards the other officer. Unlike Nie Mingjue, Jiang Cheng is silent. He winces as soon as Nie Mingjue whirls to face him. “I was hit by the car tonight, but it didn't affect me. You saw the dent on that car. <em>I</em> was the cause of that.”</p>

      <p>“Is this true, Jiang Cheng?” Nie Mingjue asks.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng narrows his eyes at Xichen. “I... I...”</p>

      <p>“I <em>asked</em> you a question!”</p>

      <p>Xichen moves to stand between them, placing a hand on Nie Mingjue's chest. “One of the men was stabbed with something through their whole body,” he continues. “I did that. I stabbed him with a sword.”</p>

      <p>“You're speaking nonsense!”</p>

      <p>Xichen lowers his hand and frowns at the floor. Wangji wishes he would look up. He wants to implore his brother to stop, to leave with him, find Wei Ying—anything—<em>anything</em> but expose himself like this. They have lived for too long, <em>too long</em>, for everything to crumble away now.</p>

      <p>His eyes flicker to the exit. They need to go. <em>He </em>needs to go—but he cannot leave his brother. Not when there is now so much at stake. He is fine throwing himself into danger because he knows, if something were to happen to him, Xichen will be able to escape along with Sizhui. They will be fine without him.</p>

      <p>What a hypocrite he is. He does not hesitate to seek danger and he becomes angered when his brother tries to stop him. Now that Xichen is risking himself as well, Wangji thinks he is insane. They truly are the Twin Jades of Lan.</p>

      <p>Like him, Xichen cannot be stopped when he has his mind set on something. He meets Nie Mingjue's unwavering gaze and summons his sword.</p>

      <p>Shuoyue appears in the blink of an eye. It glows in Xichen's hand, surrounded in energy that dances around them like blue fireflies. Around them, the small room is transformed with a spiritual radiance that looks beautiful, calming, but all it does is fill Wangji's chest with needles.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue staggers back. Jiang Cheng looks at Xichen as if it hurts to see him.</p>

      <p>Xichen lowers Shuoyue with a tired sigh. “Chief Nie, do you believe in past lives?” he asks. “Would you believe me if I said I knew you from before? You were the leader of a sect, and we... we were sworn brothers, along with Meng Yao—or Jin Guangyao as he was known then.”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue shakes his head. “What...?”</p>

      <p>“There was a war. All of the sects gathered together to put an end to the Qishan Wen Sect. The three of us... We worked together to kill Wen Ruohan—well, rather, Jin Guangyao killed him.” A bitter smile tugs at Xichen's lips. “If there is a chance that Wen Ruohan now remembers, then... it is understandable why he would be trying to target us.”</p>

      <p>“What's that got to do with Wei Ying?” Jiang Cheng says. “Whatever the fuck... you two are... Why is Wei Ying getting dragged into this?”</p>

      <p>Wangji finds his voice again. “Wen Chao.” He spits the name out like it is acid.</p>

      <p>“Wen Ruohan's son, Wen Chao...” Xichen mutters. “He was brutally murdered by Wei Ying in his past life.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng scoffs but it does not reach his eyes. “Why would Wei Ying kill anyone?”</p>

      <p>“Wen Chao killed your parents back then,” Xichen answers, quietly.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng flinches as if he has been hit. Wangji recalls that Wei Ying told him Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan are also dead in this lifetime. How cruel that fate must repeat itself in this way.</p>

      <p>“So, you're telling me that you and your brother have been alive for thousands of years...” Nie Mingjue slowly says. “And Wen Ruohan somehow remembers that one of my past lives was involved in his death all those years ago?”</p>

      <p>Xichen hides Shuoyue back into his sleeve. The room returns to its dreary grey, almost as if the moment had been a simple dream. “I do not expect you to believe me, but if my theory is correct then...” He inhales a breath, calmly looking at Nie Mingjue in the eyes. “Wen Ruohan is using Huaisang to lure you. He may have also been orchestrating these attacks in order to anger you more.”</p>

      <p>“You're <em>insane</em>.”</p>

      <p>“Chief Nie. I know I have given you no reason to trust me now... But I would not lie to you.”</p>

      <p>Clutching his head, Jiang Cheng steps forward with the usual scowl etched on his face. “How do we get Wei Ying back?” he asks. “I don't care about what happened in your past lives. That's not what matters. Wei Ying's done nothing here and you're saying he's been abducted for something that happened in another life?”</p>

      <p>Nothing flickers through Wangji's expression to betray the shock he feels at Jiang Cheng's words. He seems to be accepting the notion that there are indeed past lives, as well as casting aside his feelings towards Wei Ying. Wangji thinks back to all of the past rumours he heard about Jiang Cheng; that he had tortured demonic cultivators and did not allow them to leave Lotus Pier, that he spent everyday of his life resenting Wei Ying, allowing it to twist and destroy him until many speculated he died from qi deviation.</p>

      <p>Wangji wonders if, deep down, Jiang Cheng only wanted to find Wei Ying because of the same reasons now; to ensure that he is safe, that he is home.</p>

      <p>He meets Jiang Cheng's eyes. “I will find him.”</p>

      <p>The scowl on his face does not waver. “By yourself? That's stupid. You may be immortal or whatever the fuck you're supposed to be—but do you even know how big Wen Ruohan's gang is? You'll get Wei Ying and Huaisang killed if you go by yourself.”</p>

      <p>Xichen rests a hand on Wangji's shoulder. “I'll go with him.”</p>

      <p>Wangji looks up at his brother, surprised.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng folds his arms. “Two of you is hardly going to change anything.”</p>

      <p>He is wrong. They are two immortals who have seen everything this world has had to offer. In the past, they have been exposed. They have faced whole villages of superstitious humans who wished to kill them out of fear. They ran and disappeared into the wind, hiding themselves until everyone who knew them faded to history. They have fought and killed, casting aside the rules of the Cloud Recesses in order to stay alive.</p>

      <p>When they were young and mortal, every cultivator dreamed of achieving immortality. Such power would give you anything your greatest dreams could only ever think of—and they were wrong. Immortality has given the brothers enough power to hold this world in their hands, but robbed them of everything else. Immortality changes everything.</p>

      <p>“You know nothing,” Wangji says.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's blue eyes are cold, throwing daggers in his direction. Wangji does not stir.</p>

      <p>A frustrated groan breaks through the air. Nie Mingjue turns to Xue Yang's cell door, peering into the window.</p>

      <p>“How do we know you're telling the truth?” he barks. “Why are you revealing all of this?”</p>

      <p>From inside the cell, Xue Yang shrugs. “I've got nothing else to lose.”</p>

      <p>With that being the only satisfactory answer he would receive, Nie Mingjue grumbles and leaves the suspect alone. He nods at Xichen, the deep lines of his forehead forever etched into a frown. “If this is right... If what you say isn't complete bullshit, the Wens have two hostages with them at the moment.”</p>

      <p>Xichen hums in response. “We will go to the casino.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng strands up straighter. “I'm coming with you.”</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng—”</p>

      <p>“I'm not going to stand by and do nothing when those bastards have my brother,” Jiang Cheng interrupts, glaring at Xichen.</p>

      <p>The casino... Wangji has seen it on the news several times. There have been countless disputes in there, but that is to be expected in a place where the greedy gather together. Now, it makes more sense if this is also the place Wen Ruohan uses as the headquarters for his supposed gang.</p>

      <p>Qishan is a couple of hours away from Gusu. Even if they were to take a quicker method of transportation such as flying, it is difficult to predict if Wei Ying will be there.</p>

      <p>“What if they do not bring Wei Ying to the casino?” Wangji asks. “He was only taken just now. They may take him elsewhere—”</p>

      <p>Laughter erupts from Xue Yang's cell. “Wen Chao is a coward. He won't face any of you without the protection of his father's gang.”</p>

      <p>He is still laughing when Jiang Cheng speaks. “Why are you saying all this? This is a trap.”</p>

      <p>Xue Yang lounges back on his bed, his laughter subsides into an exaggerated sigh. “Maybe. Maybe not.”</p>

      <p>Wangji narrows his eyes. It is impossible to gauge what Xue Yang could benefit from purposely allowing himself to be caught and sharing information with them. There is a likely chance he is giving them false information, or leading them straight into a trap. Either way, they do not have enough time to think of alternatives.</p>

      <p>“It is the only information we have,” he says, and he hates it.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue runs a hand through his short hair. All of the anger on his face is gone, replaced by an expression that makes him look older than he is. “Huaisang went to Qishan three days ago. He's still there now,” he says in a low voice. “Wen Ruohan was supposed to pick up Meng Yao and bring him to Qishan too.”</p>

      <p>Xichen slowly nods. “I saw Meng Yao meet with Wen Ruohan.”</p>

      <p>Turning to him, Nie Mingjue looks at Xichen with a gaze that throws Wangji back to the Sunshot Campaign. He was a formidable man known for his quick temper, yet he remained a strong leader who many depended on when they needed him the most. There is a hard-glazed determination in his dark eyes. Without the short hair and the police uniform, Wangji can almost see the old Qinghe Nie sect leader in front of them once more.</p>

      <p>“If you're telling the truth... Can you answer me one question?” Nie Mingjue asks.</p>

      <p>Xichen nods before knowing what the question is.</p>

      <p>“You say you used to know both me and Meng Yao,” Nie Mingjue says. “Tell me; can Meng Yao be trusted?”</p>

      <p>Wangji hears the sharp intake of breath his brother hisses in. He watches him from the corner of his eyes, noting the way his hands slowly clench into fists.</p>

      <p>“No,” Xichen answers after a while. He hides the grimace on his face too late. “No, he can't be trusted.”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue's expression turns grim. “We infiltrate the casino. I'll call my men as soon as we secure the hostages, then we shut the place down.”</p>

      <p>Xichen frowns, shaking his head. “We? No, let my brother and I—”</p>

      <p>“<em>Don't</em> tell me to stay behind,” Nie Mingjue snaps. “If my brother is involved in all of this, then this is personal.”</p>

      <p>Wangji slowly turns away from them, fixing his eyes on the door. Infiltrating the casino will not be difficult. If, by some miracle, Xue Yang has told them the truth, then it will be easy to find the Wens. With how willing Xue Yang was to give this information, there is no doubt this is also a trap—but what can they do to harm Wangji and Xichen? The Wens died in the Sunshot Campaign; they cannot be immortal. They cannot do anything to them.</p>

      <p>The biggest risk would be exposing themselves. Nie Mingjue and Jiang Cheng's reactions have been contained, but there is no doubt that panic would ensue if the large masses at the casino were to witness anything from the Jades.</p>

      <p>It doesn't matter. Nothing matters apart from bringing Wei Ying back.</p>

      <p>“Then it is settled,” Xichen says. His gaze travels across all of them, lingering last on Wangji. “We leave for the casino.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looks up at the clock on the wall. It is almost one AM. “Now?”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue nods. “Now.”</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Nightless City does not sleep. Wen Ruohan sits back on his chair, listening to the endless murmur of conversation and music. He keeps his eyes fixed on the glass of wine in his hand, watching the liquid ripple as he moves it back and forth. His casino is just as busy now as it is when the sun rises. Every night and every day, the same people pile back in, wasting their lives away in vain hope that they will win something far bigger than them. They never do, and they destroy themselves with disappointment, only to come back the next day.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan finds it funny. It is so easy to control them.</p>

      <p>It's always been like this. He touches his lips to the cool edge of the glass, letting the wine slip down his throat. Ever since he was young, he could remember a different life much more vivid than the one he's currently living. As a child, he would dream of brutal deaths, all caused by his order. He would say one word, and many would fall to their knees, or to their deaths. He'd dream of fire and blood, of pleading families and burnt homes, and he'd wake up and feel nothing but nostalgia. He lived his life through memories, not the present.</p>

      <p>As he grew older, he understood. He had died before, too soon, and he had been given another chance to rise back from the ashes. He recognised faces that he used to know, and he committed them to memory, never letting go. The years passed. He lived his life as any human would, but stirred in the madness of his past inside. His two sons returned, naïve and without memories of their previous lives. It further cemented the belief onto Wen Ruohan's head that he was special, that only he was granted with the privilege of remembering everything.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan couldn't have his sons growing up into a world they weren't prepared for. He told them everything; of the war, of their home, of the people who killed them. The deaths, especially, he <em>remembered. </em>He described them as you would a bedtime story. Wen Xu had been decapitated by Nie Mingjue, and Wen Chao tortured for months by Wei Wuxian. Like him, he filled their childhood with barbarous memories of their past. They listened, they understood, and of course, they feared. Wen Xu grew up as callous and silent as he once was, heeding his every word with emptiness in his eyes. Wen Chao was as pathetic as ever, glancing behind his shoulder at all costs in case the Yiling Patriarch returned for him.</p>

      <p>As luck would have it, Wei Wuxian was the first incarnation he came across. He had only been a child; too young to cause any threat—but he was alive, and he was a reminder that this life was all a game to Wen Ruohan. He wanted to see how easily the pieces would fall into place if he played with them. He saw Wei Wuxian with his family, living a life that seemed so different from his past.</p>

      <p>Back then, he knew Wei Wuxian had been an orphan. Wen Ruohan returned that life to him. He had his parents killed, and laughed at how <em>easy</em> it had been. In fact, his life was an exercise for Wen Ruohan to test the power he had. People were easy to manipulate if you promised them what they wanted, and in time, he had a following almost as formidable as his past sect. Nowhere near as large, but it was enough.</p>

      <p>He only needed one order to kill Wei Wuxian's parents, and another to kill the Jiangs. The deaths were quick, and even quicker to be covered up. Wen Ruohan felt as if nothing could touch him.</p>

      <p>Everything is as it was, and still, Wen Ruohan is not finished. Not yet.</p>

      <p>“Checkmate,” Meng Yao says from across the room. It's followed a tired groan from Nie Huaisang, who sits by him.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan watches them, silent. His gaze lingers on Meng Yao.</p>

      <p>His face is the one he remembered the most. It was the last thing he saw before he died; an emotionless pair of brown eyes staring down at him with no remorse. Every time he envisions it, he wants to wring Meng Yao's neck with his bare hands, to watch him die just as he did.</p>

      <p><em>Not yet,</em> he thinks. It was a stroke of luck to find Meng Yao so easily, and so willingly. He was young and impressionable, and Wen Ruohan found it effortless to gain his trust by giving him everything he had ever dreamed of. Killing him would be too quick. Too merciful.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue was more difficult. His father was a fool, both in the past and now. Killing him again was no problem—but killing Nie Mingjue needed more time. Instead, Wen Ruohan toyed with him. Wen Xu had personally organized the attacks, making sure they didn't reveal anything but they were savage enough to catch the police's attention. For months, they watched as Nie Mingjue and his men ran around in circles, with no idea as to who, or what, they were facing.</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen... Lan Xichen caught him off guard. For all of these years, he failed to see him once, to the point that he began to think he never would—until now. As soon as he caught sight of the First Jade, Wen Ruohan realised that it was time. All three of them were here. The pieces are in place. This is why he was reborn with all of his memories; for this.</p>

      <p>He drinks the rest of his wine and savours the bitterness that fills his mouth. Before him, Meng Yao and Nie Huaisang continue to waste their time, unaware of what stirs in his mind. He invited them to his casino tonight, under the guise of relaxing before their awards event later.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan glances at the time. Almost one AM, and yet they're all still wide awake.</p>

      <p>He isn't tired. Not tonight.</p>

      <p>“It's not like you to lose,” Meng Yao says, gathering the chess pieces. “Is there something on your mind?”</p>

      <p>Nie Huaisang groans for the second time. He lays his head on the table and fills this room with his irritating whines. “Da-ge and I had a fight. I wanted him to go to the awards but he said he didn't have time.”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao looks at him with sympathetic eyes. “Chief Nie is very busy with all the attacks occurring in Gusu right now.”</p>

      <p>“I know,” Nie Huaisang sighs. “I... I should call him now. I feel bad for yelling at him earlier.”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao stops reaching for the chess pieces. Frowning, he looks at his watch. “It's late.”</p>

      <p>“Da-ge has a late shift tonight. He should still be awake.”</p>

      <p>“Won't he be busy?”</p>

      <p>Insistent, Nie Huaisang shakes his head. He won't sit still, already reaching for his phone. “It'll only be a quick call. I can't focus on anything at this rate.”</p>

      <p>Sighing, Meng Yao motions to an untouched glass of wine. “Have a drink first,” he urges. “You need to calm down.”</p>

      <p>Nie Huaisang eyes the glass as if he expects it to bite him. “You're right,” he mumbles and relaxes back into his seat. He reaches for the wine, taking a small sip. “What's this?”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao smiles. “Manager Wen's favourite.”</p>

      <p>“It's very bitter,” Nie Huaisang comments, squinting at Wen Ruohan. Nevertheless, he drinks back the entire thing with a grimace.</p>

      <p>Tired of their useless drawl, Wen Ruohan pours himself another glass. After the awards event, everything will fall into place. He had thought of the small details, obsessed over each consequence that should arise.</p>

      <p>With Meng Yao's rising popularity, it is too easy to turn all of that fame against him. Nie Huaisang is a good pawn to sacrifice. He clung onto Meng Yao when it was needed, and tonight would be no different.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan only needed to kill Nie Huaisang and frame it on Meng Yao. After that, Meng Yao will lose everything, just as Wen Ruohan had when he had torn that blade through him all those centuries ago.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue will follow, as soon as he realises his brother is dead. Wen Ruohan has already given Wen Xu the task of killing him.</p>

      <p>He hides his smile behind his glass, swallowing back the bitter wine. Of course, he knows Wen Chao has taken matters into his own hands and headed straight for Wei Wuxian. He's useless and his fear of the past will only hold him back, but Wen Ruohan cares little for what happens with Wei Wuxian. He will kill him as easily as he will kill everyone.</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen is the only piece he hasn't considered for long. He settles the glass of wine back on the table, narrowing his eyes at his reflection. He had been reckless, too quick in making his decision to attack him. He didn't care if he ended up killing the Jade too soon, or even if he failed for now. Wen Ruohan felt he needed to do <em>something, </em>and he did.</p>

      <p>He has still not heard back from his men. Either Lan Xichen is now dead, or he has somehow avoided the attack. Wen Ruohan glances back at the time. Why have his men not called him back yet?</p>

      <p>Another whine from Nie Huaisang interrupts his thoughts.</p>

      <p>“I... I don't feel good,” Nie Huaisang mumbles. Clutching his head, he rises to his feet.</p>

      <p>He only takes one step forward before he falls straight into the ground, limp and lifeless.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan frowns. He, too, stands up. Nie Huaisang doesn't move a muscle. It couldn't have been the alcohol; he has only drank that one glass for the entirety of tonight.</p>

      <p>Slowly, Wen Ruohan turns to Meng Yao. He is still sat down on his chair, calmly draining his own glass of wine as he watches Nie Huaisang with a blank expression.</p>

      <p>It's the same look he had when he killed Wen Ruohan. In an instant, Wen Ruohan feels fire burning through his entire body, a rage he has kept for all of his existence.</p>

      <p>“What did you do?” he asks, each word laced with acid.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao finishes his wine, still looking at the unconscious man on the floor. “Nie Mingjue will be coming soon.”</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan narrows his eyes.</p>

      <p>Finally, Meng Yao turns to him. “Don't be so shocked, Manager Wen,” he says. “I've known all along. Why do you think I've been spending so much time with Nie Mingjue and Huaisang?”</p>

      <p><em>He should have known. </em>He should have known that Meng Yao's starry-eyed dreams were nothing but an act. Here he had thought that he was manipulating him all this time, using his own aspirations to blind him from Wen Ruohan's true goal. Wen Ruohan's anger consumes him. He wants to crush Meng Yao's thin neck. His pride burns at how he hadn't known—all this time, he thought that Meng Yao was oblivious. <em>All this time.</em></p>

      <p>“Explain yourself,” he forces out through gritted teeth.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao sits back. His face is devoid of any emotion; not even that infuriating smile he faked all the time. “The meaningless attacks; you knew it would anger Nie Mingjue. At first, I thought you were doing it because his father had tried to expose you before...” He shakes his head, and there—that smile now surfaces. “But then you saw Lan Xichen yesterday. I know you recognised him.”</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan grinds his teeth together. Had Meng Yao only realised yesterday, then?</p>

      <p>“It got me thinking... Out of everyone, you scouted me. I was nothing, and yet you chose me.” The smile on Meng Yao's face widens. It doesn't reach his eyes. “It was because you knew me from before, wasn't it?”</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan gives him no answer.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao nods as if he still understands. “You remember everything, Wen Ruohan. Just as I do.”</p>

      <p>He remembers too. <em>He remembers.</em></p>

      <p>A sharp smile tugs on Wen Ruohan's lips. He suddenly wants to laugh at how destiny has twisted everything. “Then you should think about why you're here right now.”</p>

      <p>“Are you trying to bring Da-ge and Er-ge here?” Meng Yao tilts his head. “Have us reunite so you could kill us just as we killed you? Is that it?”</p>

      <p>Again, Wen Ruohan refuses to answer him. Meng Yao's eyes are large, too innocent on someone like him. Clenching his fists, Wen Ruohan stands his ground and watches as Meng Yao rises to his feet.</p>

      <p>“I told Xue Yang to stop the attack you planned on Er-ge. He's going to lure Da-ge and Er-ge here instead. They should be coming soon,” Meng Yao tells him. He pauses, as if remembering something. “If Wen Chao took Wei Wuxian as well, then... Lan Wangji will be coming too.”</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan fails to keep the frown off his face. “What are you planning?”</p>

      <p>When Meng Yao looks at him again, his eyes are cold, empty. “Just as you remember who killed you, I remember who killed <em>me,</em>” he says. “If you want to kill me, that's fine, Wen Ruohan, but let me have Lan Xichen first.”</p>

      <p>So, his yearning for revenge coincides with Wen Ruohan's. Fate is truly a funny thing. Wen Ruohan allows a scoff to escape him. He would be a fool to trust Meng Yao a second time, but if he is luring the same people that Wen Ruohan wants to kill, then he will play his little game. For now.</p>

      <p>“What do you want?” he asks.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao smiles. “Closure.”</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan can only laugh.</p>

      <p>Deep in the night, Wei Ying is lost in dreams and memories that mix together. He can't wake up and he can't see where he is. He's trapped in a void of black that won't end, won't respond to him when he asks <em>what's going on, where am I</em>—<em>Am I dead?</em></p>

      <p>He doesn't think he is. He remembers, now, what death is like. It's nothing like this. Death was peaceful, and he didn't want it to end. He had never wanted to come back.</p>

      <p>He was someone else, and he had died. The man in Lan Zhan's portrait. Him. <em>Him.</em></p>

      <p><em>Me, </em>Wei Ying thinks. <em>That was me.</em></p>

      <p>He breathes into the cold abyss of this dream. There's still nothing that greets him. The silence is loud, and he thinks it's trying to tell him all of the answers that he seeks. No matter how much he listens, all he hears are his own frustrated questions.</p>

      <p>He can't wake up, but he's not dead. Not yet. Wei Ying is stuck in a limbo where he doesn't even know if he's <em>Wei Ying</em> anymore.</p>

      <p>Deep in the night, he sleeps and dreads for the sun to rise.</p>
