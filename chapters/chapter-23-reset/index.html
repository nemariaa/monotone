      <p>Warnings for heavy violence, body injuries, and some graphic scenes!</p>

    <div class="fic-text">
      <p>The Nightless City is nothing like it used to be. A towering skyscraper of neon and gold looms over them; unrecognisable from the majestic building that Wei Ying had drowned in blood all those years ago. Inside, a kaleidoscope of contrasting colours meet their every step, accompanied by drunken shouts and overexcited cheers. It is past three AM and the night should be silent—but not here in the Nightless City.</p>

      <p>Here, it is crowded with scantily dressed people waving their cash, drinking glass after glass of alcohol. Everywhere Wangji looks, there are games being played by the large tables, surrounded by onlookers who either watch with amusement or frustration. The music is deafening, although not loud enough to drown out their screams of defeat as they lose even more money.</p>

      <p>There is too much going on. They have managed to pass the lobby with no problems whatsoever but that gives him little comfort. Considering they've walked through the front entrance with no effort to conceal themselves, Wangji thinks this is too straightforward. His every step is tense and heavy, waiting for a trap to spring forth.</p>

      <p>Regardless of how easy it had been to enter this place, that does not solve the matter of finding Wei Ying and Nie Huaisang. There are too many floors in this building and not enough time for them to scour each corner and room.</p>

      <p>“This place is bigger than I thought,” Jiang Cheng says. His voice is almost inaudible through the music and countless people around them.</p>

      <p>What he has said is a vast understatement. They are still on the ground floor and this is one of the first rooms they have entered. This room alone is so large that Wangji cannot see where it begins and where it ends.</p>

      <p>“Where's Wei Ying and Huaisang?” Jiang Cheng asks when no one responds to him.</p>

      <p>Wangji glances up at him; a silent reminder to be quiet.</p>

      <p>Besides him, Xichen sighs. “I don't know.”</p>

      <p>“Can't you sense them or something?”</p>

      <p>Wangji can only frown. He is suddenly reminded that they are with two humans who shouldn't be here. As useful as Jiang Cheng's assumptions would be, he doesn't have the ability to sense anyone, especially not in a place like this. There are too many around; too many hearts that beat the same rhythm, too many voices that make it impossible for him to think.</p>

      <p>“No,” Xichen says. He turns to look at all of them. “Do not bring attention to yourselves.”</p>

      <p>Although he addresses this to all of them, Wangji does not fail to notice that his gaze lingers on him. He remains silent as he continues to scan their surroundings. It would only take seconds to expose themselves in a place as crowded as this. One slip and the panic would spread like wildfire. It would be catastrophic. Wangji clenches his hands into tight fists, hating this feeling of everything teetering on the edge, ready to tumble down.</p>

      <p>He ambles through the room, eyeing the strange games that are being played. Nearby, he sees Nie Mingjue also observing the games tables. With the way he glares at everyone, one could mistake him to be a security guard although he is no longer wearing his uniform.</p>

      <p>“Where can I find Wen Ruohan?” he asks a woman drinking by herself.</p>

      <p>The woman's kohl-outlined eyes roam over Nie Mingjue before she smirks. “Wen Ruohan?” she asks, leaning closer to stroke his chest. At this, Nie Mingjue's glare hardens but he does not move away. “You must be new.”</p>

      <p>She takes another sip of her glass, leaning back. “Wen Ruohan always stays in his private room. No one ever sees him out here.”</p>

      <p>“Where's that?” Jiang Cheng asks.</p>

      <p>Winking at him, she finishes the rest of her drink and pushes it away. She does not wait a second before ordering another.</p>

      <p>“It wouldn't be private if we knew,” she says.</p>

      <p>They leave the stranger to drink in peace. If Wen Ruohan is in this private room she has mentioned, then Wangji doubts it is anywhere near here; at least not somewhere as accessible as the ground floor.</p>

      <p>Even so, that is barely enough information to find the hostages or the Wens. Trying to find Wei Ying in a place as large as this reminds Wangji of the endless years he has spent searching for him. He is suddenly thrown back to every country, every village, every corner of this world that he has scoured in his long, long life. He does not miss the hopelessness that fills him; the feeling that he <em>should</em> be able to sense if Wei Ying is here—but he can't. All he feels is the slow building panic that threatens to overcome him, whispering in his ear that he should forget about hiding their identities and do everything in his power to find Wei Ying—find him <em>now.</em></p>

      <p>One look at his brother is the only thing that grounds him. Wangji clenches his fists tighter and pushes those thoughts away.</p>

      <p>A few minutes pass until he hears a group of murmurs. None of the games are interrupted, but the number of people who look up are enough to catch Wangji's attention. He glances over his shoulder, spotting the man who has just entered the room. There are several other men with him, each dressed in black suits with red ties; similar to the guards on this floor.</p>

      <p><em>Jin Guangyao. </em>Even from this distance, Wangji knows it is him. He quickly turns away, slowly walking behind a crowd to hide himself. Xichen, Jiang Cheng and Nie Mingjue are not too far; they have also blended themselves around a poker table, pretending to watch the game.</p>

      <p>Wangji keeps his eyes on the game in front of him but listens out for Jin Guangyao in case he draws nearer.</p>

      <p>Someone from another table beckons the actor over. “Guangyao! Care to spare a game?”</p>

      <p>Ducking his head down, Wangji sees Jin Guangyao approaching the man's table with a pleasant smile.</p>

      <p>“I'm a bit tired now,” he says. “Perhaps next time.”</p>

      <p>The man nods. “What about Huaisang?”</p>

      <p>“He's gone to sleep. He isn't feeling well.”</p>

      <p>As ever, Jin Guangyao is an expert at lying. He says something else that makes the entire table laugh but Wangji has stopped listening. His gaze wanders to Xichen's table. The two brothers exchange silent glances. Wangji does not need any words to know that Xichen is telling him to stay where he is. For all they know, Jin Guangyao has already seen them and he's only waiting for—</p>

      <p>“You <em>bastard!</em>”</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes snap to Nie Mingjue. Before anyone can stop him, he is lunging towards the actor.</p>

      <p>It all happens at once. Everyone around the poker table screams, sending chips and cards flying into the air. Xichen and Jiang Cheng try to stop the enraged man a second too late. Nie Mingjue shoves past chairs to get to Jin Guangyao, but the guards are faster than him. They come in hoards, holding him down until even his brute strength cannot escape them. Within seconds, Xichen and Jiang Cheng are surrounded as well. The entire room is filled with shocked whispers and curious eyes; throughout it all, Jin Guangyao's face remains calm. The smile on his face has not moved.</p>

      <p>Wangji holds his breath. While most of the gamblers around them are now distracted with the commotion, there are some who roll their eyes and return to their games. <em>This must be a daily occurrence in the casino</em>, he thinks, remembering how the news often reported that this place was notorious for violence and disputes.</p>

      <p>He remains rooted on the spot, still hidden behind this group of men in front of him.</p>

      <p>What does he do? Does he help them? But that would mean getting caught as well; he cannot free them without using cultivation. <em>If</em> he uses cultivation, this entire room will see and chaos will follow.</p>

      <p>“Shit, that's Nie Mingjue.”</p>

      <p>He almost doesn't hear the voices. They travel in hushed whispers amidst the chaos, coming from two guards who stand three tables away.</p>

      <p>“We need Wen Zhuliu back with Leader Wen,” the first guard says, glancing around him as if to make sure no one is listening.</p>

      <p>His friend stands up straighter. He looks far too young to be a security guard, let alone part of Wen Ruohan's gang. “He's with Wen Chao,” he says. “I saw them upstairs half an hour ago but not since then.”</p>

      <p><em>Wen Chao? </em>Wen Chao is not with his father?</p>

      <p>Xichen meets Wangji's gaze. His eyes widen slightly, jerking his head in a quick nod that's almost unnoticeable.</p>

      <p>Wangji releases the breath he is holding. His brother looks away before anyone sees them. No words are needed; that has always been the case for the Twin Jades. Wangji spares one last glance at his brother and slips away from the crowd.</p>

      <p>Xichen will be okay. His brother is strong. Stronger than him, and certainly more rational as well. He will be fine. They all will.</p>

      <p>He repeats this in his head. Wei Ying will be okay. Wangji will find him and, together, they will go back home. After, he will tell Wei Ying everything. He will answer every question that he has with no hesitation. He will no longer hide.</p>

      <p><em>Upstairs. </em>That guard had said Wen Chao was upstairs. There must be over fifty floors in this building.</p>

      <p>Wangji walks faster, slipping past gamblers whose attentions are still fixated on the disruption in the ground floor. He ignores them and makes haste for the stairs.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying is somewhere in this building. He will find him. He has to.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Wei Ying feels the pain first. His subconsciousness tries to cling onto sleep but the throbbing in his head forces him awake. Did he somehow end up drinking last night? The dizziness and the headache would explain it—just not to this extent. He's had hangovers before – too many, actually – but not like this. Never like this.</p>

      <p>Opening his eyes is a mistake. He isn't met with the stained ceiling of his apartment; instead, he frowns at black walls and leather chairs. A deep, crimson carpet lays beneath him, crusted with what he first thinks are stains—they're not. Groaning, Wei Ying clutches his head. His hand is met with something damp around his crown, and when he takes it away, he can't say he's surprised to find it covered in blood.</p>

      <p>Before he can think about what this means, a hard kick on his shoulder sends him toppling back. Pain explodes where the foot met his bone. For a second, Wei Ying thinks he's broken something. He clutches his shoulder and inspects the damage, gritting his teeth at the burning sting that drowns his head. Not broken. But it's enough to tell him this <em>isn't</em> a hangover.</p>

      <p>Panting, Wei Ying looks up. He takes in the slim fit of the dark suit, the red shirt underneath, the golden chains at his neck and wrists. Unlike his clothes, this man's face isn't attractive. You wouldn't look at him twice in the street; his skin is too pallid, sinking around his eyes and his cheeks. He glares at Wei Ying with dark, beady eyes that are red around the edges.</p>

      <p>Everything returns to Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>This man was outside his apartment... And then—and then, he was attacked. After, everything went black.</p>

      <p>“You don't scare me,” the man hisses, looking down at him as if he's dirt on his shoe.</p>

      <p>His voice is high-pitched and pompous. In the back of Wei Ying's mind, he knows he's heard it before—way, <em>way</em> before. He's heard it in his nightmares, screaming for the destruction of his own home and family.</p>

      <p><em>Wen Chao</em>. He narrows his eyes at this man, seeing him in robes outlined with rays of the sun. It's gone in a second; replaced by this trembling stranger in front of him.</p>

      <p>“You don't scare me!” he says again, voice cracking and eyes widening in rage. He moves quick; sending another kick at Wei Ying's stomach. “You're <em>nothing!</em>”</p>

      <p>All the air is forced out of Wei Ying's lungs. He curls in on himself, biting down hard at his bottom lip to stop the cry of pain that nearly leaves him. Above him, he hears the rushed pacing of footsteps. Wen Chao is circling the room, mumbling to himself in half-deranged whispers that he can't hear.</p>

      <p>The room spins. Wei Ying is forced up on his knees; rough hands yank his arms, holding them behind his back. He has no energy to search for who's holding him, and neither does he care. Wen Chao stops pacing the room.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying would laugh if he could. Being forced to kneel before Wen Chao... This has happened before, hasn't it? Somewhere, somehow. He swallows down the lump in his throat and meets the dark eyes that scowl at him. When he looks at this man, he feels nothing. In another time, he may have felt hatred and anger. Now? Nothing.</p>

      <p>“I... I don't even know who you are,” Wei Ying says. He can't hear his own voice, but he knows Wen Chao has. He tenses and strikes Wei Ying across the face, sending his head knocking to the side.</p>

      <p>“<em>You're nothing!” </em>Wen Chao shrieks again. “You can't hurt me here!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying ignores the spinning of the room. The pair of hands that hold him are too strong. They grip him tighter until his arms feel like they're going to break. Still, he forces himself to look at Wen Chao straight in the eyes.</p>

      <p>“What exactly did I do?” he asks, slowly.</p>

      <p>There's small victory in the way Wen Chao flinches.</p>

      <p>“You killed me. Tortured me. <em>Humiliated</em> me,” he spits out. “My father told me how you mutilated my body, taking pleasure in your sick deeds. Ever since I was a child, I'd have nightmares of someone taking me away, just to torture and kill me slowly for their own amusement.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's first reaction is to tell him he's fucking insane. He's never met this guy before in his entire life—much less <em>tortured</em> him. In fact, he can say for certain that he's never, ever tortured anyone.</p>

      <p>He wishes it was that simple. The more he looks at Wen Chao, the more he remembers. That fire wasn't just a dream. None of it is. They're too real, too nostalgic to remain as dreams. As much as it frightens and confuses him, he knows they're real. They <em>were</em> real.</p>

      <p>What does that make him? <em>Who</em> does that make him?</p>

      <p>He looks down at the floor. “What... <em>exactly</em> did I do?”</p>

      <p>“<em>Shut up! </em>I'm not answering to you!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying clenches his jaw. “Why am I even here? <em>I've</em> done nothing of what you've said—!”</p>

      <p>Another strike to his face silences him.</p>

      <p>“Don't play dumb with me! You remember! You <em>must</em> remember!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying tastes blood on his lips. He licks it away and glares up at the deranged man. “Then, tell me, what is it I'm supposed to be remembering?” he asks again.</p>

      <p>For the second time, Wen Chao flinches. He stands up taller, as if trying to look imposing when, really, he is far from it.</p>

      <p>“<em>Our past lives!” </em>he snaps. Whatever composure he was trying to fake is gone in seconds. His hands are shaking so violently that Wei Ying isn't sure if he's going to hit him again or if he's going to run.</p>

      <p>He may not remember everything but he knows this Wen Chao is nothing like the one in the past. <em>He's always been pathetic, </em>the back of his mind tells him, <em>but even now... He's just nothing.</em></p>

      <p>“I've done nothing to you. This is the first time I've ever met you,” Wei Ying says, trying to remain as calm as he can. “Whatever happened in the past... that wasn't me. That wasn't you either.”</p>

      <p>For one, short second, he thinks he's reached him. Then, Wen Chao blinks and he's grabbing his hair, shaking him so hard that Wei Ying's thoughts scramble.</p>

      <p>“<em>I'll kill you! </em>I'll—I'll—!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying grits his teeth. “Can you? Have you ever killed anyone before in your whole life?”</p>

      <p>That makes him stop. Wen Chao lets go of him as if he burns.</p>

      <p>From what he can remember, the man in his dreams laughed and enjoyed inflicting pain on him. He was stuck up, thinking himself powerful and untouchable. Now, Wen Chao flinches with anything Wei Ying says. He strikes because he's scared; not because he enjoys it.</p>

      <p><em>He's had nightmares about me torturing him for years,</em> Wei Ying thinks. No matter who he was in the past, those nightmares will change even the most wretched man.</p>

      <p>“You've just been listening to whatever your dad's told you. Whatever you were in the past; you're nothing like that now,” Wei Ying tells him. “You're too scared of me.”</p>

      <p>His words hit home. Wen Chao takes a step back.</p>

      <p>The door slams open. Both Wei Ying and Wen Chao jump, turning towards the man who runs into the room. He's dressed in what looks like a security guard's uniform. <em>Where exactly are they? </em>The man pauses as soon as he sees the scene in front of him, quickly avoiding Wei Ying's eyes.</p>

      <p>“I-I'm sorry to interrupt b-but Leader Wen has asked for Wen Zhuliu,” he says, keeping his head down.</p>

      <p>Wen Chao frowns. His dark eyes flicker to the man holding Wei Ying. None of them move.</p>

      <p>“T-They're here. Wen Ruohan asked for Wen Zhuliu immediately,” the guard says again. As soon as he mentions the name <em>Wen Ruohan</em>, the grip around Wei Ying loosens.</p>

      <p>“They're here... They're here...” Wen Chao mutters. He whirls to face Wei Ying just as soon as Wen Zhuliu lets him go. “N-No... No! I won't let them win this time!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying doesn't get a chance to think about running. As soon as he looks up, he's staring into the barrel of a gun.</p>

      <p>He freezes.</p>

      <p>'Deranged' doesn't even cover Wen Chao now. He's shaking so hard that Wei Ying fears he'll accidentally press the trigger.</p>

      <p>“I'm not scared of you! I'm <em>not</em> scared of you! I'll kill you!” he shrieks, filling this entire room with the cracks of his voice.</p>

      <p>It's odd. Staring into the gun pointed straight at him, he feels strangely calm. He wouldn't say he's not scared, because he <em>is, </em>but he's not <em>angry. </em>Wen Chao is a crazy bastard who doesn't know what he's doing.</p>

      <p>Even so, how different is he to Wei Ying now? Driven to madness because of a past he doesn't understand... Wei Ying can't find it in himself to be angry. He's just tired.</p>

      <p><em>They're here. </em>That's what the guard said. Who?</p>

      <p><em>Lan Zhan?</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying keeps his eyes on the gun. He doesn't dare to move a single muscle.</p>

      <p><em>I want to talk to Lan Zhan, </em>he thinks. <em>I want to see him.</em></p>

      <p>His thoughts are dashed away. A cold, clammy hand grips his wrist and he's looking into Wen Chao's twitching eyes. The gun's barrel digs into his temple as Wen Chao drags him forward.</p>

      <p>The only thing Wei Ying can do is stumble with him. Wen Chao takes him out of the room and into a darkly lit corridor. It's empty, spacious, smelling faintly of cigarettes. There's no one around, save for the two of them. Wen Chao pulls him along; the gun in his shaking hands are a reminder for Wei Ying not to do anything reckless.</p>

      <p>He considers trying to escape or shouting for help, but he's not dumb. This place, whatever it is, must belong to Wen Chao's family. There are guards that answer to them, guards that accept the fact Wei Ying's been abducted. That room they were in looked expensive, and this corridor here is large, filled with countless doors that lead elsewhere. Wei Ying has no idea what this building is; he just knows there's no denying that Wen Chao's family is rich. Rich, powerful, and corrupted.</p>

      <p>If he tries to escape, there's no doubt that he'll only run into more trouble. He's not risking anything. Not now.</p>

      <p>Wen Chao pushes him through a metal door. When he stumbles inside, Wei Ying is greeted by an endless flight of stairs. The hollow sound of silence greets him.</p>

      <p>The gun digs into his back. <em>“Go,” </em>Wen Chao orders, shoving him forward. “Hurry up!”</p>

      <p>Not knowing what else he can do, Wei Ying does as he's told. He climbs up the stairs, counting each step he takes. There's no end to them. His legs ache and his head throbs. He counts up to one hundred and two, tripping over a step that's too high up. When he stops for a second too long, Wen Chao kicks him forward and threatens that he'll shoot his leg.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying takes a deep breath and pushes himself up. Starting from zero, he counts again. It's the only thing that keeps him calm, especially with that gun pressed against his spine.</p>

      <p>By the time they reach the top, Wen Chao all but kicks him through the door. Wei Ying braces himself against the hard ground and struggles for breath. His legs are jelly and there's no strength left in him to stand. The cool air bites into his skin and there's nothing but the endless expanse of the night sky staring down at him. He grips the cement floor, taking deep breaths, shivering with each blast of the wind.</p>

      <p>Wen Chao has taken them to the rooftop.</p>

      <p>He grabs Wei Ying by the hair and lifts him to his feet. The world spins in circles. All he can see is the black sky and the small dots of lights beneath them. Wei Ying tries his best to stay calm; panicking isn't going to help and it's only going to show Wen Chao he's terrified.</p>

      <p>Regardless, the sight of the city beneath him isn't helping. Wen Chao drags him forward. Each step he's forced to take is heavy, accompanied with the lurch of his stomach.</p>

      <p>They reach the edge. The wind roars in his ears and his heart slams against his ribs. A distant memory pulses in his head; him looking down at the Burial Mounds, staring into the abyss that Wen Chao would later push him into.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying stops breathing.</p>

      <p>Digging his fingers into his arm, Wen Chao presses the cold barrel of the gun to his head again.</p>

      <p>Neither of them move. Time stops. Wei Ying can only look at the city below him.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Meng Yao approaches them calmly. There is a small frown on his face, although it's too composed, too perfected, to be real.</p>

      <p>“Chief Nie, Xichen-ge... and Jiang Cheng?” He shakes his head, disappointment filling his brown eyes. “What's going on here?”</p>

      <p>He's a good actor. He always has been.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue struggles against the men holding him, shouting every curse known to man. Throughout his tirade, not once does Meng Yao blink. Xichen knows the smug calm in his face will only further enrage the older man—and he's right. Nie Mingjue struggles more.</p>

      <p>“Don't play dumb! Where's Huaisang?!” he demands.</p>

      <p>Sighing, Meng Yao looks at him as if the answer is obvious. “He's resting. Didn't he tell you about the awards event later tonight?”</p>

      <p>The guards struggle to keep Nie Mingjue in line. He lurches forward again. “<em>Bastard! </em>Wen Ruohan is responsible for all the attacks! <em>You knew</em> all along!”</p>

      <p>As expected, the crowds around them break into shocked whispers. They look towards Meng Yao, expecting an answer.</p>

      <p>Slowly, Meng Yao lets out an amused laugh. “Are you drunk? This isn't like you, Chief Nie.” His laughter subsides into another sigh. He opens his mouth and then closes it, hesitating. “A-Sang's been telling me that both of you have been constantly fighting about his job as an actor. I understand you're very protective, Chief Nie, but A-Sang is old enough to make his own decisions now. You need to stop this.”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue's frustrated growl fills the entire room. He is red with rage, unable to escape the grip of the security guards.</p>

      <p>“<em>You—!”</em></p>

      <p>“If you truly have an issue with Manager Wen...” Meng Yao raises his voice over him. “Then you will have to address those matters to him.”</p>

      <p>In an instant, Nie Mingjue stops.</p>

      <p>A hint of a smile tugs on Meng Yao's lips. “But keep in mind this establishment belongs to him. Please refrain from disrupting it any further than you already have.”</p>

      <p>His little order is enough to send Nie Mingjue tensing again. Xichen lays a hand on the chief's shoulder, nodding in his direction. They need to find Wen Ruohan; if this is the only way then so be it.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue says nothing; the annoyed grunt he lets out is enough of an answer. Besides him, Jiang Cheng frowns at Xichen. There is a silent question in his eyes: <em>Is this okay? Is this safe?</em></p>

      <p>Willingly walking into Wen Ruohan's hands is never a good idea but they have no other choice. If needs be, Xichen will resort to what he can in order to get everyone out safely.</p>

      <p>Meng Yao tilts his head at them. “I didn't realise all three of you were so closely acquainted. I'm a bit confused, I must admit, but we'll save the questions for later.” He relaxes into a smile. “Shall we? I will show you all to Manager Wen.”</p>

      <p>Leading them through the maze of this casino, Meng Yao takes them into different corridors and rooms. All the while, Xichen bores his eyes into his back and repeats Nie Mingjue's question a few hours earlier.</p>

      <p><em>Can Meng Yao be trusted?</em></p>

      <p>Xichen has always tried to see the good in everyone before he judged them. Even now, part of him wants to think that Meng Yao has no reasons to be like this, not when this life has been so generous. Are his crimes so deeply rooted that not even a new life will change him?</p>

      <p><em>Stop, </em>Xichen tells himself. Meng Yao already fooled him before. He cannot make the same mistake. Out of everyone, <em>he</em> should know the extent of what Meng Yao can do. After all, it was him who drove that blade into his heart, staring deep into Meng Yao's shocked eyes as he breathed his last.</p>

      <p>Xichen tears his eyes away from him. Meng Yao hasn't changed, and neither will he if he keeps believing him.</p>

      <p>Finally, Meng Yao stops in front of a black door. He spares them one final smile, stepping aside.</p>

      <p>Xichen is the first to enter. He is greeted by the smell of wine and peppermint invading his senses. A large rectangular table made of ebony is in the centre, various cards and discarded chess pieces strewn all over it. It is the first thing you see entering and the last you pay attention to. Behind it, on the far side of the room, are black leather couches; and there, in the middle, sits Wen Ruohan. Even without the long hair and the sun-decorated robes, he is unmistakable. Nevertheless, now that he is much closer, it is easier to see the differences from his original body. His hair is short and slicked back. There are fine lines ageing his face, but that is to be expected when you no longer have cultivation to keep you young. Regardless, the signs of age around his eyes do not deter from the confident air he presents himself.</p>

      <p>He is every bit as arrogant as Xichen remembers him.</p>

      <p>They are not alone in this room. Next to him is a man that brings back memories of fire and blood.</p>

      <p><em>Wen Xu.</em></p>

      <p>Xichen only has one memory of Wen Xu; a memory that has never left him—<em>will </em>never leave him.</p>

      <p>He burnt down the Cloud Recesses and killed their father. He stood in Xichen's home, with eyes as empty as glass, and ordered everyone to burn more, <em>more</em>. It was only when the Library Pavilion was set aflame did he finally allow a smile to grace his cold features.</p>

      <p>Xichen never forgot that smile.</p>

      <p>Ice slides through his veins as he stares at Wen Xu now; not because of who he is, but because of who he is holding.</p>

      <p>Nie Huaisang struggles against him. His cries die down into a terrified hiccup as a gun is pressed against his head. He stands still, eyes wide.</p>

      <p>In an instant, a furious cry comes from Nie Mingjue. He lurches forward, shoving past the guards who see him too late.</p>

      <p>A deafening crack pierces the air. In less than a second, Nie Mingjue screams out and collapses to the ground, clutching his leg. Blood pools beneath him, staining the red carpet into a deeper shade of crimson. Xichen and Jiang Cheng run to help him but they're quickly stopped by guards who point guns in their direction. An eternity passes as they look around them, surrounded. The only sound they hear is Wen Ruohan sitting back on his couch, laughing; the glass of wine in his hand is as red as Nie Mingjue's blood.</p>

      <p>“<em>Da-ge!” </em>Nie Huaisang cries, struggling even as Wen Xu presses the gun against his head once more. He turns to Meng Yao, eyes wide and red with tears. “<em>No! </em>Stop this! Please!”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao looks away.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan rises. He stares down at Nie Mingjue in disgust.</p>

      <p>“You're just as annoying as your father,” he says.</p>

      <p>He jerks his head. In the blink of an eye, several more men surround the injured chief. They drag him up to his knees, kicking the gunshot wound, and forcing out another struggling cry from him.</p>

      <p>The sound breaks through Xichen. His eyes flicker to Huaisang, who is still begging for them to let go of his brother.</p>

      <p>Xichen had allowed Nie Mingjue to come with them. He can't allow Huaisang to lose his brother <em>again.</em></p>

      <p>He counts the guards in the room. Four around him and Jiang Cheng. Five by Nie Mingjue.</p>

      <p>He moves fast, faster than they can see. Xichen summons his sword and cuts a path of blood, killing the men around them in less than one second. He spots the widening of Wen Ruohan's dark eyes as he makes quick work of the men by Nie Mingjue, not allowing them even a moment to scream before he plunges his blade into their stomachs. He has never liked killing. Old rules are difficult to discard, and the rule of <em>no murdering</em> rings in his head with each drop of blood he spills. He grits his teeth and steps back, staring at the carnage he has caused.</p>

      <p><em>There's no other way, </em>he reminds himself.</p>

      <p>With that, he turns towards Wen Xu and lunges straight for him.</p>

      <p>Xichen sees his slow-motion reaction; a blink of an eye, a slight twitch in his arm as he directs the gun in his direction—but he's too slow, too late.</p>

      <p>And then, something catches in the corner of Xichen's eyes. <em>Someone. </em>He moves like lightning. As quick as a strike of thunder, he slams his fist into Xichen's chest and everything erupts into <em>agony.</em></p>

      <p>He's thrown back, head slamming against the hard floor. Fire burns his senses, overwhelming—<em>too much. </em>He writhes where he lays and all thoughts leave him. The pain drains him entirely, robbing him of every strength, every energy he has in his body. It comes too quickly, like a black hole that swallows everything he is inside. </p>

      <p>In the back of his mind, he hears Jiang Cheng screaming his name. Wen Ruohan's laughter soon drowns it out.</p>

      <p>Even as the pain subsides, there's something wrong.</p>

      <p>Xichen cannot move. He tries to push himself up and <em>rise, </em>but his limbs are as weak as a child's. His heartbeat stutters. His body is cold. Too cold.</p>

      <p>He breathes harder.</p>

      <p>Too, <em>too</em> cold.</p>

      <p><em>No.</em></p>

      <p>He looks up.</p>

      <p>As soon as he sees who it was that had struck him, his eyes widen.</p>

      <p><em>Wen Zhuliu. Core-Melting Hand.</em></p>

      <p><em>No. It can't be.</em></p>

      <p>He struggles to breathe now. Xichen clenches his trembling fists and tries to summon back his sword.</p>

      <p>It is only now that he notices it's on the floor, shattered into pieces.</p>

      <p>Wen Ruohan's laughter echoes in his head. He sits back on his chair, grinning.</p>

      <p><em>No, no, no.</em> Xichen stares at the shattered remains of his sword and wills his spiritual energy to respond. There is nothing but the cold void in his chest, the uneven stutter of his heart. He feels cold and small. Empty. <em>Human.</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng rushes to his side, helping him to his knees. Regardless that he holds him, Xichen is drained entirely, struggling to even keep his head upright.</p>

      <p>“Don't worry. You won't die—yet,” Wen Ruohan says, draining his glass of wine. He sets it down on the table with a gentleness that only mocks them. “I must say; I didn't expect that you'd be an immortal as well. What a stroke of luck that Wen Zhuliu is here.”</p>

      <p>Xichen can barely find the voice to speak. “How...?”</p>

      <p>The leader nods at Wen Zhuliu. “Tell him.”</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu stands up straighter. His hair is as long as before; the only difference from his original body is that he now wears a black suit rather than the Wen Sect robes.</p>

      <p>“After the Yiling Patriarch killed me, I was reincarnated. I slowly recollected my memories and vowed to avenge my masters,” he explains in a monotonous voice.</p>

      <p>It is impossible to let that sink in. He had heard of stories that Wei Wuxian delighted in torturing Wen Zhuliu along with Wen Chao. The rumours were so horrifying and shocking that Xichen never knew if they were exaggerated or the horrible truth.</p>

      <p>If what Wen Zhuliu is saying is true, then it meant that he reincarnated afterwards. Not only that, his new reincarnation was able to reach immortality just as Wangji and Xichen did; and like them, he, too, waited centuries to be reunited with the people he knew.</p>

      <p>“He waited for all of these years in order to find me again,” Wen Ruohan says, as if reading his thoughts.</p>

      <p>Xichen shakes his head. “Why... Why go through all this effort?”</p>

      <p>“The same reason that you're still here. Haven't you been alive all this time?” Wen Ruohan grins. “Like you, we can't let go of the past.”</p>

      <p>At this, Meng Yao steps forward to join Wen Ruohan's side. The smile playing on his lips is long gone. It is difficult to tell what emotion is running through his head but Xichen knows one thing is certain; Meng Yao is truly working with Wen Ruohan.</p>

      <p>The former Wen Sect Leader looks between them, amusement glinting in his eyes. “What a lovely reunion.”</p>

      <p>Meng Yao is the first to break eye contact. He scans the room, frowning. “Lan Wangji isn't here,” he informs the older man.</p>

      <p>Xichen cannot help but frown. It's unlikely that Meng Yao has <em>just</em> noticed that Wangji is not with them. He has always been observant. If he knew Wangji would be with them, he would have noticed his disappearance immediately, back in the ground floor.</p>

      <p>“Ah, you're right,” Wen Ruohan agrees, still smiling at Xichen. “I'm guessing he's immortal like you?” He faces Wen Zhuliu and nods. “He's probably after Wen Chao. Stop him.”</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu hesitates. He narrows his eyes at Xichen.</p>

      <p>“Lan Xichen can't do anything now.” Wen Ruohan smirks.<strong> </strong>“And none of them will dare risk Huaisang's precious life.”</p>

      <p>As a reminder, Wen Xu shakes Huaisang in his arms and digs the barrel of the gun harder against his skull. Huaisang's cries cause his brother to look up.</p>

      <p>“You son of a bitch,” Nie Mingjue spits out.</p>

      <p>With a stiff nod, Wen Zhuliu leaves the room as quickly as he came. As soon as he is gone, Wen Ruohan sits back, pouring himself another glass of wine.</p>

      <p>“Now then,” he says with a voice as smooth as silk, “where were we?”</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Twelve years ago, Wei Ying probably wouldn't have cared if he was about to get pushed off a skyscraper or have his brain blown up by some crazy man with a gun. Twelve years ago, he would have laughed and told Wen Chao to hurry up, get it over with. Now, as he stares down at the endless view of the city below them, he realises he doesn't want to die. He wants to live. He wants to get the fuck away from this place. He wants to see Lan Zhan again. He doesn't want <em>this.</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying squeezes his eyes close. His knees knock together and his breaths only make him dizzier. None of the plans in his head are making sense; all he can think of is <em>I don't want to die, I want to see Lan Zhan again.</em></p>

      <p>He <em>can't </em>die. Not here. Not now.</p>

      <p>Why is this happening? Why does this need to happen? Even if he did something in the past, does it matter now?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying forces himself to open his eyes again. He licks his dry lips and breathes through his nose, out his mouth. He repeats this for a few seconds until he finds the strength to speak.</p>

      <p>“Have you killed anyone before? I don't mean back then; I mean <em>now.</em>” When Wen Chao doesn't answer, Wei Ying raises his voice. “I don't even know what's going on. I barely remember anything, and even if I did... I...”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying gulps. “I wouldn't have come after you. The past is the past. Why can't we just focus on <em>now?</em>”</p>

      <p>“Shut up!” Wen Chao screams down his ear, roughly shaking Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>For a second, Wei Ying's heart stops as he feels his feet shuffling closer to the edge of the skyscraper. He'd rather Wen Chao shoot him dead. He doesn't want to fall down here; the descent is so long he'd have time to actually think about it.</p>

      <p>He looks up, focusing instead on the starless sky.</p>

      <p><em>Talk,</em> he decides. <em>Just talk. It's all you can do. Distract him. Scare him. Do </em>something.</p>

      <p>Wen Chao is a bit like him. He remembers things that he doesn't understand, things that scare him. Unlike Wei Ying, he's been remembering them since he was a kid; hounded by nightmares every night, every year, every time he closed his eyes. It would drive anyone to madness.</p>

      <p>He keeps his eyes fixed on the crescent moon, so thin you can barely see it. “If you kill me, is that going to stop your nightmares?” he asks in a low voice, “or are you just going to convince yourself that I'll still come back for you?”</p>

      <p>It works. He hears the unmissable hitch of Wen Chao's breath.</p>

      <p>Still no answer. Wei Ying watches him from the corner of his eyes. “What's stopping me from finding you again?”</p>

      <p>“<em>Shut up!”</em> Wen Chao snaps. He shakes Wei Ying again. This time, he rattles him so hard that Wei Ying's foot slips forward and his heart lurches in his throat. For a short, heart-stopping moment, he thinks Wen Chao will let go of him and watch him fall. But he doesn't.</p>

      <p>“If you let me walk away now, I'd forget about you!” Wei Ying insists. “I don't care about anything from the past! I'd walk away and leave you alone—!”</p>

      <p>Again, Wen Chao pushes him forward. He grips onto his arm, staring down at the microscopic cars beneath them. The wind roars at both men, singing in chorus with the rampaging of Wei Ying's heartbeat. Wen Chao only needs to let go of him and he would be plummeting down this skyscraper.</p>

      <p>“You've never killed anyone before, have you?” he asks again. It's a miracle he can still talk at this rate.</p>

      <p>“My family have—”</p>

      <p>“But <em>you</em> haven't! Killing me won't get rid of your nightmares! If you kill me now, you'll remember it for the rest of your life!”</p>

      <p>Wen Chao digs the gun harder against his skull. “You'll be dead! I won't care!”</p>

      <p><em>After I die, I’ll definitely become a ferocious ghost and haunt the Qishan Wen Sect day and night, cursing all of you!</em></p>

      <p>“That's not true,” Wei Ying says as he hears his own voice echoing in his head, thousands and thousands of years ago. “You'll think about it for the rest of your days. You'll be convinced I'll come back for you as a vengeful ghost. That's what I did last time, right?”</p>

      <p>The gun against his head starts shaking.</p>

      <p>“<em>Stop talking! Just stop it!”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying doesn't listen to his desperate orders. He speaks again, because it's all he can do, and because he thinks he's reaching Wen Chao. He's close to it.</p>

      <p>“I just want to live my own life. I'll leave you alone, if you let me go,” he says, punctuating each word as calmly as he can. “We don't need to be the same people we were in the past.”</p>

      <p>Wen Chao is no longer pressing the gun to his head. Hope flutters in Wei Ying's chest.</p>

      <p>“This is all I've ever known,” Wen Chao whispers. It's the weakest Wei Ying has heard him tonight.</p>

      <p>He swallows the lump in his throat. “It doesn't have to be.”</p>

      <p>The grip around him loosens. He waits for Wen Chao to step aside, let him walk away.</p>

      <p>Nothing. Wei Ying counts the seconds that pass, faced with only the daunting view of the city spread out before him.</p>

      <p><em>Go. Run. Don't give him a chance to change his mind.</em></p>

      <p>He wishes he can remember what it felt like to be as brave as he used to be. Whatever he was in the past, he is nothing like that now. He's only human and he's <em>scared.</em></p>

      <p>But he's also desperate.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying counts to ten. <em>One, two, three, four, five. Six. Seven.</em></p>

      <p><em>Eight.</em></p>

      <p><em>Nine.</em></p>

      <p><em>Ten.</em></p>

      <p>He takes a deep breath and smashes his elbow into Wen Chao's stomach. A cry pierces his ears, followed by the earsplitting crack of a gun. He feels nothing. No pain. No exploding of his brain. As the longest second passes, Wei Ying realises it narrowly missed his head. He slips out of Wen Chao's grip and throws himself onto the floor, shaking.</p>

      <p>When he looks back up, Wen Chao is still standing by the edge of the skyscraper, pointing the gun straight at him.</p>

      <p>Panting, Wei Ying raises both hands and shakes his head. “Just let me go. You'll never see me again. I won't hurt you. I don't want anything to do with you.”</p>

      <p>He's tired. He wants to go home. There's only so much that he can take in one evening. The nightmares were bad enough, but actually facing potential death because of something he doesn't even understand is too much. This is all too much. It's all so ridiculous that he wants to laugh.</p>

      <p>Maybe it's not just Wen Chao who's crazy here.</p>

      <p>“Don't you <em>hate</em> me? I had the whole of Lotus Pier burned down! <em>I</em> killed the Jiangs!” Wen Chao screams.</p>

      <p>In another time, Wei Ying would hate him. In another time, he <em>did. </em>He hated him so much that he made it his goal to kill this man as painfully and slowly as possible. He mutilated his flesh and fed them to him after he took pleasure in peeling them off, layer by layer, piece by piece.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying clutches his head, forcing the images away.</p>

      <p>“I barely even know what's going on. I don't remember everything. I don't know how this is all happening,” he says, clinging onto what's left of who he is. Whoever he used to be... He would never do those things now. “Whatever happened in the past... This is 2019 now. Are we even the same people anymore?”</p>

      <p>Wen Chao grips the gun tighter. “My father killed your parents.”</p>

      <p>“I said the past is in the—”</p>

      <p>“<em>No! </em>I mean now! He killed your parents when you were younger! He told me himself! He had his men break into your house and murder them!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's blood runs cold.</p>

      <p>“And he was also responsible for that car accident that killed the Jiangs.” Mad laughter escapes Wen Chao, shaking his shoulders with tremors. “You say the past is the past, but everything is still the same! Nothing ever changes! <em>Nothing will!</em>”</p>

      <p>For the first time tonight, he sees red. All of his life, he had wondered why, <em>why</em>, those burglars had to choose <em>their</em> home, <em>his</em> family. He convinced himself that the Jiangs died because of <em>him. </em>He spent countless nights dreaming of their mangled bodies in that car, screaming at himself for putting them in that situation. They gave him a home and he gave them death in return.</p>

      <p>For the first time tonight, he understands why he hated the Wens so much. Wei Ying pushes himself to his feet, glaring at Wen Chao through damp eyes.</p>

      <p>“That's because all of you won't let go of the past!” he snaps. Wen Chao flinches at the rise of his voice but Wei Ying doesn't care. “If you all forgot about it, if you just focused on <em>this life</em>, then none of this would have happened! You could be living away from this, not even knowing who I am! You didn't have to do <em>anything! You didn't have to touch them!</em>”</p>

      <p>Wen Chao shakes his head desperately. “But I <em>do</em> know who you are! Every night, I remember what you did to me! Every night, I relive through it!”</p>

      <p>He sounds so pathetic. The evident fear in his eyes does nothing for Wei Ying. Maybe, if he was as sadistic as he used to be, he would have taken pleasure in seeing Wen Chao panic like this. Maybe he would have already tried to push him down the damn skyscraper. Maybe.</p>

      <p>But not now. Now, he only wants to go home. Wen Chao is only as terrified as he is.</p>

      <p>“Nothing will change,” Wen Chao continues. He is no longer pointing the gun at Wei Ying. He holds his head in his hands. It's difficult to tell if he's laughing or crying. Or both. “Even if I let you go, I'll still remember you!”</p>

      <p>“But killing me won't change that either,” Wei Ying says.</p>

      <p>He's tired. He wants everything to stop. He wants to go home, see Lan Zhan again—hear his voice. He wants to put this behind him, put <em>everything</em> behind him.</p>

      <p>He doesn't expect Wen Chao to step back. Behind him, the night sky is an empty void. He lets go of his head and stares at Wei Ying with wide, bloodshot eyes.</p>

      <p>“It's all your fault... It's all because of <em>you!</em>” he screams. He shuffles back again, until the heels of his shoes hang off the edge.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying tenses. “Stop. You're going to fall.”</p>

      <p>“You won't leave me alone. You'll never leave me alone!”</p>

      <p>Wen Chao is an ugly crier. He shakes his head again and again, enough to make him wobble.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying lurches forward. “I said <em>stop!</em>”</p>

      <p>He doesn't really hear the gunshot. He sees Wen Chao's wide, panicked eyes. He sees the gun aiming for him again, the smoke that leaves it as Wen Chao looks away and pulls the trigger. He sees the sky, still as empty as ever, with no stars left to illuminate it. And finally, he sees the river of blood that spills out as he clutches his stomach.</p>

      <p>Then, he feels the pain, travelling through his body like the fire that engulfed his home thousands and thousands of years ago. Wei Ying gasps. He doesn't know when he falls to the ground. He doesn't know how to breathe. Every breath he takes is another stab to his stomach. The more he presses down on the gunshot, the more blood that spills out. His head spins. The world spins.</p>

      <p>Wen Chao drops the gun onto the cement ground. He says something but Wei Ying can't hear him through the hollow silence that blocks his ears.</p>

      <p>He doesn't get to see Wen Chao's face. He hears a scream loud enough to pierce through the spinning of his head. Wen Chao takes one final step and throws himself off the building.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The screams happen all at once. Wangji stops, whirling around him to find the cause. Everyone stumbles to the left side of the room, pushing past each other to stare outside the windows.</p>

      <p>“<em>Oh my god!”</em></p>

      <p>More screams. There are some who are heaving, covering their mouths in an attempt to stop. A woman has fainted.</p>

      <p>“<em>What happened?”</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Someone jumped off!”</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Jumped off? What?”</em></p>

      <p>“<em>From the rooftop!”</em></p>

      <p>His heart stops. He slips past the crowd and finds the nearest window. They are only on the second floor, but he sees. He sees enough.</p>

      <p>The body, if it can still be referred to as such, is no longer recognisable. He has seen a lot of things he would rather forget in his life; this is no different. Wangji swallows back the bile in his throat and focuses on the clothes instead; the only thing still identifiable to the eyes. A black suit. Wei Ying would not have worn a black suit tonight.</p>

      <p>He quickly looks away and leaves the room. <em>The rooftop. </em>That was where they came from. Wei Ying has to be there.</p>

      <p><em>Please be safe,</em> Wangji prays. <em>Please.</em></p>

      <p>He contemplates using an elevator but pushes that idea aside. They are slow and far too many people are using them. Instead, he rushes to the back staircase, thankful that it is deserted. Once he deems it safe, Wangji summons his sword and flies up, as fast as he possibly can.</p>

      <p>Someone fell off the rooftop and it was not Wei Ying.</p>

      <p><em>Wen Chao? One of Wen Ruohan's men?</em></p>

      <p>What's happened up there?</p>

      <p>The questions drive him mad. Wangji flies faster, <em>faster. </em>Wei Ying will be okay. He has to be. <em>He has to be.</em></p>

      <p>Cold air hits his face as soon as he reaches the rooftop. The first sight he lays eyes on is the endless sky enveloping them in a blanket of jet-black. Another breeze washes through him, sending shivers up his spine.</p>

      <p>He looks down. The shivers turn into icicles that pierce his back. Wei Ying is on the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood.</p>

      <p>“<em>Wei Ying!” </em>Wangji screams. <em>No. No!</em></p>

      <p>He runs forward, every thought in his head screaming, <em>begging. Praying. </em>He needs Wei Ying to be okay. He cannot lose him again. He can't do this—</p>

      <p>There, in the corner of his eyes, something flashes.</p>

      <p>Wangji turns just in time, blocking the attack. He's met with dark eyes and an ageless face; a face he knows he has seen before. Jumping back, the man glares at him. He lands on his feet and wastes no time in lunging towards Wangji again. Spiritual energy envelops his right fist, sparking with crimson electricity.</p>

      <p><em>Core-Melting Hand. </em>Wangji throws himself back, dodging another punch directed at his chest. <em>He's alive? A cultivator?</em></p>

      <p><em>No.</em></p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu is as agile as he is, matching Wangji's dodges with attacks that are faster than the last. Without a sword, he relies strongly on close combat, luring his opponent enough to melt their core. <em>Predictable</em>. Wangji keeps his distance, focusing solely on blocking him. He dares not risk an attack, knowing that's what Wen Zhuliu wants. As soon as he strikes, Wen Zhuliu will use that opening to melt his core; Wangji will not give him that chance. Even though his tactics fail, Wangji feels the tremors of Wen Zhuliu's spiritual energy reverberating through his bones every time his fist misses. He grips his sword tighter.</p>

      <p><em>Not just a cultivator. </em>This man is an immortal like him.</p>

      <p>Wangji clenches his jaw, eyes flickering to Wei Ying. He doesn't have time for this.</p>

      <p>A glint flashes in Wen Zhuliu's eyes, something akin to triumph. He launches back at Wangji, hand outstretched.</p>

      <p>The blow never comes.</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes widen, realising too late that the attack was never for <em>him. </em>Whirling around, he faces Wei Ying and throws himself between their path. He sees crimson and electricity, turning his shoulder in time for the fist to miss his chest. Wen Zhuliu grips his shoulder hard—</p>

      <p>Pain erupts through Wangji's entire body. It lasts less than a second, but it is enough to shake every bone and limb in his body. He has never felt anything like it; he doesn't think the Core-Melting Hand could ever do something like this—</p>

      <p>Wangji's sword is knocked away from him. It clatters to the ground the same time he falls to his knees, still feeling tremors that burn his veins. Although Wen Zhuliu missed his, Wangji's body feels drained. Spiritual energy stirs inside him, but no matters how much he tries, he can't summon the strength to control it. He is numb. Only numb.</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu's eyes are as black as the sky. His hand sparks again, painting his pupils with crimson. Wangji can do nothing but watch.</p>

      <p>Just as his fist makes contact, a blaring shot cleaves the air. It is followed by sudden silence.</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu stands still, eyes wide with shock. His arms fall to his sides and the energy around his fist crackle into a thin wisp of smoke.</p>

      <p>He falls into a heap on the cement ground, blood pooling around his head. It grows steadily, enveloping him in a puddle as crimson as the Wen Sect's robes. There is a look of shock permanently etched on his face.</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu does not move a single muscle. He is dead.</p>

      <p>Wangji forces himself to his feet. Underneath him, the ground spins and threatens to meet him. He ignores it, scrambling to Wei Ying's side.</p>

      <p>Panting, Wei Ying drops the gun. He tries to laugh but it comes out as weak coughs, causing more blood to gush out from his stomach.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying!” Wangji calls. He turns him over, lifting him into his arms, stiffening at how <em>cold</em> he is. There is no more colour left on his skin and his eyelids are heavy, eyes barely focusing on him. When Wangji holds him closer, his head lolls to the side.</p>

      <p>“Lucky shot,” Wei Ying mutters.</p>

      <p>Wangji stops thinking. He fumbles to close his hands around the wound. No matter how deep he presses, blood pours between his fingers and spreads around them. He shakes his head, <em>praying, praying, praying. </em>As he presses on the wound, he summons his spiritual energy and—</p>

      <p>Nothing.</p>

      <p><em>No.</em></p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu missed when he tried to take his core away. Wangji's core is <em>still </em>here. He can <em>feel</em> it.</p>

      <p>His core responds, trying to heed his commands. Spiritual energy surges inside him but—<em>nothing. </em>A barrier stops him, numbing his senses before he can summon it forth.</p>

      <p>Wen Zhuliu missed, but he has made it impossible for Wangji's spiritual energy to respond now.</p>

      <p><em>No.</em></p>

      <p>Wangji panics. His hands shake and his eyes sting. <em>No. This cannot happen. No!</em></p>

      <p>Blood continues to pour out.</p>

      <p>“No. No, Wei Ying,” Wangji begs. He holds Wei Ying closer to his chest, pressing down on his wound as much as he can. There's so much blood. Too much blood.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyes flutter open. “You know, I... I...” He struggles to speak, broken by wheezes for breath. “When I... started remembering... I... I was so scared.”</p>

      <p>Wangji freezes. He looks down at Wei Ying and sees a small smile tugging on his pale lips.</p>

      <p>“I didn't know what... what was going on. I still don't.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyelids droop close. A surge of terror envelops Wangji. He clutches him tighter.</p>

      <p>“Stay awake. Stay with me,” he pleads.</p>

      <p>A cold palm weakly falls over his hand. Wei Ying's thumb weakly strokes his blood-soaked skin. </p>

      <p>“But I... I'm glad... I'm glad you found me again.”</p>

      <p>Wangji can only beg for him to stay awake. He is still trying to summoning his spiritual energy but the seconds tick on and Wei Ying's eyelids are slowly closing. He shakes him, as if it's the only thing keeping him here.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's hands stop moving. The next breaths he takes are laboured and long. Still, the smile on his face remains.</p>

      <p>“W-What... Whatever happened in the past... I'm happy... that... that we met.”</p>

      <p>The smile slips. His eyes close.</p>

      <p>Nothing.</p>

      <p>Wangji waits for him to say something else, to open his eyes, to smile at him.</p>

      <p>Nothing.</p>

      <p>“No. No, no, Wei Ying.” Wangji shakes him again. Wei Ying's head falls to the side. <em>“Wei Ying.”</em></p>

      <p><em>Nothing.</em></p>

      <p>“Wei Ying, please. Please, I'm here,” Wangji calls, again and again, again and again. No matter how much he shakes Wei Ying, his eyes won't open.</p>

      <p>He is no longer breathing. He is as still as a statue.</p>

      <p>Tears blur his vision. He holds Wei Ying's cheek and trails his trembling hand down to his neck, pressing it against the vein.</p>

      <p>Nothing. No pulse. <em>Nothing.</em></p>

      <p>He refuses to accept it. He <em>can't</em> accept it. This must be a mistake. This cannot happen again. He can't lose him <em>again. </em></p>

      <p>“Don't leave me,” Wangji begs. “Wei Ying. Wei Ying, <em>please.</em> Not again.”</p>

      <p>There is no answer. He clutches Wei Ying's body and buries his face into his chest, finally allowing himself to cry.</p>

      <p>Above them, the sky is a void that has swallowed all of the stars—except one. It glimmers and glints, watching as the lone immortal sobs for his lost lover. The star is the only thing that hears Lan Wangji's cries.</p>

      <p>It listens, and it waits.</p>

      <p>(Please don't kill me. There's about seven or eight chapters left of this fic ok okkOKKKKK I'M SORRY)</p>

      <p>Anyway, this was difficult to write. It's weird writing characters like Wen Chao as something like this... but I figured, if you lived your entire life traumatised by memories of someone graphically torturing you in a past life, then I don't think I would escape that sane... What I love about the reincarnation trope are topics like this. If person A is a reincarnation of an evil villain, but in their new life, person A has different environments/different memories, would they still grow up to be the same person? In some cases, yes (like WRH), but in WC's case... not so much. He's not an angel but he hasn't necessarily done anything apart from follow his crazy dad and his slightly crazy brother. In this AU, he hasn't killed anyone because he's too scared to, so.... does that still make him a bad person? HMM. Also, I never actually intended to go down this path with WC at all. But it just sort of... flowed this way. It would be interesting to see what you guys thought of this!</p>

      <p>ALSO I'm aware that in the real world, this is NOT how police handle stuff like this but honestly I gave up with keeping things logical in a law sense for this arc. It's hard incorporating logical police procedures into a fic with immortal cultivators while trying to make it work with your plot, and I can't say I've ever broken into a gang hideout with the police before to know how they handle things so just go with it 🙃</p>
