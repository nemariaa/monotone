    <div class="fic-text">
      <p>Although they are family and Wangji insists he does not have to pay, Lan Qiren still offers an extremely large amount of money for Jingyi's music lessons. Wangji is Jingyi's last hope in growing up to be a respectable young man worthy of the Lan name, or so his uncle insists. While the rest of the world seems to have disregarded the history of cultivators, the Lan family cling onto their roots.</p>

      <p>Lan Qiren does, anyway. Over the years, Wangji and Xichen have told the incarnations of Lan Qiren their true identities, and every incarnation took it well. Too well, in fact. They were all too happy to preserve as much of the family pride, even if it meant little to the Twin Jades now.</p>

      <p>All that aside, Wangji wonders if his uncle will be happy with the fact that Jingyi has spent today's music lesson creating a Timber account for him instead of sitting down by the piano and playing <em>something</em>. Anything.</p>

      <p>All of them are sitting on the couch, watching as Jingyi wrote Wangji's profile with inhuman speed. The teenager makes him sound more exciting than he really is. According to Jingyi, Wangji enjoys strolling around the city, drinking coffee with his friends, and he is very, very rich.</p>

      <p>Wangji cares little for exploring the city and he does not even have any friends to begin with. He <em>is</em> rich though.</p>

      <p>“Is it necessary to say he's rich?” Sizhui says.</p>

      <p>Jingyi shrugs. “Eh, everyone loves a sugar daddy.”</p>

      <p>“A sugar daddy?” Wangji asks. He is, technically, a father but he is not a big fan of sweet food. Xichen had the sweet tooth, not him.</p>

      <p>Xichen chuckles above them. He is standing over the couch, watching Wangji's phone screen with some concern in his eyes.</p>

      <p>“Perhaps erase the sentence about his wealth, Jingyi,” he suggests.</p>

      <p>Jingyi groans but nevertheless does what he's told. “Okay, okay. Now we just need to edit your preferences. Uncle, what age range of women do you wanna see? And how far are you willing to travel to them?”</p>

      <p>Instead of answering him, Wangji snatches the phone from his hands and stares at these options himself.</p>

      <p>How old is Wei Ying now? He looks slightly older than when he was the Yiling Patriarch but Wangji doubts he has reached mid thirties yet. To be safe, he moves the age range around late twenties and early thirties. Frowning, he also switches the preferences to men rather than women.</p>

      <p>“Wait,” Jingyi said. <em>“Men?”</em></p>

      <p>His eyes are wide as he looks between all of them.</p>

      <p>“Oh. <em>Oh.”</em> Jingyi nudges Sizhui, who has begun to look down at his hands. “Did you know?”</p>

      <p>“As long as Dad's happy then it doesn't matter—”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, but did you <em>know?</em>”</p>

      <p>Sizhui shakes him off. He looks back up at Wangji and gives a little smile.</p>

      <p>“No, I didn't,” Sizhui says. “But like I said, Dad, I'm fine with it!”</p>

      <p>Wangji returns the smile. He already expected Sizhui will not react badly but his chest is still filled with relief.</p>

      <p>“Oh, someone's picture has appeared.” Xichen leans over and points at the stranger suddenly on Wangji's screen.</p>

      <p>“So, you swipe left if you don't like them or swipe right if you like them,” Jingyi explains.</p>

      <p>Wangji does not even look at the man's name. He moves his finger to the left and watches as the picture disappears.</p>

      <p>“Aaw, why did you swipe left?” Jingyi asks.</p>

      <p>“Not interested.”</p>

      <p>In fact, he spends the next ten minutes swiping every picture to the left, not sparing a second to read any of their profiles, let alone their names. Why is he wasting his time on this thing? He has not seen Wei Ying so far and he is beginning to doubt he ever will. All of the profiles flashing in front of his eyes look the same. Wangji's mood sours even more.</p>

      <p>“Oh!” Xichen's voice causes him to stop.</p>

      <p>It is not Wei Ying but it is a familiar face.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng,” Wangji says.</p>

      <p>Even the picture he has of himself is scowling. It looks like someone has taken a picture of him and he is very unhappy about it. Nevertheless, if he is using this as his profile picture then he must approve of it to a degree. Beside his name is his age, Wangji assumes. He is thirty-three, apparently. Does that mean Wei Ying is the same age?</p>

      <p>Jingyi leans over and moves his finger up on the screen. Jiang Cheng's picture vanishes, replaced by a wall of text.</p>

      <p>“Swipe up if you wanna look at their bio,” Jingyi says. Wangji is beginning to wonder just <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> he knows so much about this dating contraption.</p>

      <p>All of them fall silent as they read through what Jiang Cheng has written.</p>

      <p><em>Requirements for me: You must be naturally beautiful, graceful and obedient, hard-working and thrifty. You must come from a respected family and your personality is not too strong. Don't talk a lot, or have a voice that's too loud. You must be good with saving money. Lastly, you must treat my nephew nicely.</em></p>

      <p>“Is this a bio or a job application...?” Jingyi mumbles, his lip curling.</p>

      <p>Xichen lets out what sounds like painful laughter. When Wangji looks at him, he is shaking his head to himself.</p>

      <p>“Who is he?” Sizhui asks, confusion on his face as he looks between the two brothers.</p>

      <p>“Sizhui, he was the one who arrested me...”</p>

      <p>At this, Sizhui chuckles into his hand. News of Xichen's arrest had been a conversation starter in the dinner table for the past few days. They were careful to not let Lan Qiren find out, however. There is no telling how he will react if he finds out Xichen, out of all people, was arrested.</p>

      <p>“There's more,” Jingyi says, scrolling down Jiang Cheng's profile. “P.S. I'm straight. I just don't know how to change these Tinder settings.”</p>

      <p>Sizhui laughs even more, trying his best to hide it with a series of fake coughs.</p>

      <p>Jingyi, on the other hand, throws his head back and practically cackles. “Haha, what an idiot!”</p>

      <p>“Jingyi, that's rude,” Xichen gently, but sternly, says. Despite this, there is a smile on his face. “Anyway, let's move along. I take it Wangji does not want to match with Officer Jiang.”</p>

      <p>To no one's surprise, Wangji swipes left.</p>

      <p>More minutes are spent swiping left on all these strangers. In the corner of his eyes, he can see Jingyi getting impatient, groaning with every man he rejects. Wangji spares no one his attention. There are too many men posing in front of their mirrors wearing almost no clothes at all; Wangji makes sure to send a glare before he promptly gets rid of them.</p>

      <p>He is just about to swipe left again when Jingyi grabs his phone.</p>

      <p>“It's Chief Nie!” he gasps. “He's on Tinder too?”</p>

      <p>Xichen leans over, turning Wangji's phone to face him. They open his profile, only finding one short paragraph.</p>

      <p><em>This is Nie Mingjue's brother making a profile for him. Please date him so he'll finally stop forcing me to get married instead. He has a six pack and can be nice if he wants to.</em></p>

      <p>A sigh comes out from Xichen. He stands back again, returning Wangji's phone to him.</p>

      <p>Jingyi nudges Sizhui. “Hey, isn't Chief Nie's younger brother famous now?”</p>

      <p>“He is?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, he's an actor in this new drama, Crimson Heart! He's with that other actor—what's his name...”</p>

      <p>Sizhui shakes his head with a smile. “I don't watch those things...”</p>

      <p>“You should!” Jingyi yanks on Sizhui's arm, almost making him fall over on the couch. “I'm gonna make you watch Crimson Heart with me next lesson! You need to cry!”</p>

      <p>Wangji frowns. “No distractions during lessons.”</p>

      <p>He says this as if they are not being distracted right now. Lan Qiren will collapse if he ever walked in on this.</p>

      <p>“Nie Huaisang is an actor?” Xichen asks.</p>

      <p>Jingyi nods eagerly, clearly ignoring Wangji in favour of listening to Xichen instead. “You watch Crimson Heart too, Uncle Xichen? Who's your favourite prince?”</p>

      <p>Xichen laughs lightly, shaking his head. “No, I don't. I just know his name.”</p>

      <p>“Aaw... but yeah, he's an actor—and he's really good!” Jingyi's face is animated as he talks. Wangji has never seen the teenager look so excited. “There's another actor who's always in the same shows as him but I can't remember what his name is. They're both nominated for Best New Actor in this year's TV Drama Awards!”</p>

      <p>Slowly, Xichen nods, only sparing a quiet noise of approval.</p>

      <p>“Anyway, Uncle Wangji you should swipe right. Maybe you'll get to meet Nie Huaisang!”</p>

      <p>Wangji swipes left. “Not interested.”</p>

      <p>“You're not interested in <em>anyone!”</em></p>

      <p>That is true. Wangji's patience is worn thin. He has half a mind to stop this charade and carry on with Jingyi's music lesson instead. He doesn't even know what possessed him to do this. Jingyi has a talent in distracting himself <em>and</em> others, it seems.</p>

      <p>Maybe instead of teaching the teenager how to play the piano, Wangji also needs to teach him the Cloud Recesses' four thousand and nineteen rules. It's likely an impossible task but he owes it to his uncle.</p>

      <p>He does not lose his rhythm in rejecting all of these unknown faces that appear before him. He swipes with unmatched speed and still manages to stop when something, <em>someone</em> catches his eye.</p>

      <p>“Teacher Wei!” Jingyi and Sizhui say in unison. They almost bump heads leaning in to stare at Wangji's phone.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying is on his screen with a smile on his face. It is not quite the smile that used to infuriate Wangji's confused emotions back when they were in the Cloud Recesses. There is an edge in Wei Ying's eyes that looks teasing but it feels unfamiliar, unknown. Wangji shifts in his seat and almost forgets to look at his profile. Jingyi is the one who clicks on it for him.</p>

      <p><em>Not looking for anything serious but let's hang out ^__^</em></p>

      <p>That is it. Wangji's eyes narrow at what that short sentence can mean. It is frustrating how much he yearns to know more about Wei Ying but no matter what, no matter how long he has waited, no matter <em>who</em> he turns into, Wangji is still struggling to understand him.</p>

      <p>“Wangji.”</p>

      <p>Xichen's voice is gentle. Concerned. He lays a hand on Wangji's shoulder and says nothing more.</p>

      <p>“What is your teacher like, Jingyi?” Xichen asks, turning to the teenager.</p>

      <p>Jingyi taps his chin, staring at the ceiling in thought. “He's nice! Everyone likes him—probably because he's not as mean as the other teachers.”</p>

      <p>“And he lets you get away with anything,” Sizhui adds.</p>

      <p>“Hey, he still gives me detention!”</p>

      <p>“Because you never do your homework...”</p>

      <p>“We can't <em>all</em> be a teacher's pet like you.”</p>

      <p>Wangji ignores the rest of their bickering. His gaze is fixed on Wei Ying's smile as he slowly swipes to the right.</p>

      <p><em>“Oooh.”</em> Jingyi actually shakes his arm. “You swiped right! You swiped right at Teacher Wei!”</p>

      <p>Even Sizhui's eyes are wide. He covers his mouth but Wangji can see the smile behind it. Above them, Xichen laughs.</p>

      <p>“I have detention with him tomorrow! I can put in a good word for you!” Jingyi says, grinning at Wangji with such intensity he has to pull his arm away and create some much needed distance between them.</p>

      <p>“No,” Wangji says. “Unnecessary.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi does not say anything. He does not need to. The grin he still has on his face is enough for Wangji to regret ever listening to him in the first place.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Wei Ying hoped today would never come. Monday mornings are never good but he already knows today's Monday morning is going to be a bad one. No doubt about that.</p>

      <p>When he was told there was going to be a new student in his class, Wei Ying saw no issues. He had no problem with any of his current students, and if there was a problem then he knows he can handle it. One more kid to add to that pile was hardly an issue at all.</p>

      <p>Now, as class starts and said student is currently glaring at him from the doorway, Wei Ying is convinced destiny must hate him along with everyone else that currently does.</p>

      <p>The headmaster already told him before today who the new student will be. Wei Ying, being the desperate idiot he was, hoped it was just someone with the same name. Surely there are other Jin Lings out here in Gusu?</p>

      <p>Well, of course not.</p>

      <p><em>A job is a job.</em> Wei Ying sighs and plasters a smile on his face, ignoring the fact that Jin Ling's scowl turns deadlier. If he got rid of that expression, he would look like his mother. They have the same eyes, after all. Same facial structure too.</p>

      <p>It dawns on him he has not seen Jin Ling in a while. He's seen glimpses of him when he was unlucky enough to come across Jiang Cheng, but that was lifetimes ago. Years. Back when Jin Ling was still a kid who clung onto Jiang Cheng's hand and Wei Ying came home hating himself even more.</p>

      <p>He isn't really a kid anymore. He's taller than Wei Ying expects, and it's not because somewhere deep down, Wei Ying hasn't stopped thinking of him as some lost child. Maybe, maybe not. He still has memories of Jiejie cradling her baby in her arms with nothing but love on her face.</p>

      <p>Has it really been that long?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's smile falters for a second. A job is a job, he repeats to himself, pushing his thoughts away.</p>

      <p>“Are you not going to come in?” he asks, raising his voice.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling doesn't move. He folds his arms and looks into the class with an upturned chin. Already, the other students are whispering among themselves.</p>

      <p><em>Typical.</em> Wei Ying resists the urge to roll his eyes.</p>

      <p>“You can't just stay there all day,” Wei Ying insists. “Come in and introduce yourself.”</p>

      <p>By some miracle, Jin Ling finally moves. He steps into the room with his eyes glued to his shoes. At the very least, he's glaring at them instead of the whole class.</p>

      <p>Painful seconds pass by before Wei Ying concludes Jin Ling will not introduce himself. He once again forces a wide smile on his face as he turns to the rest of the students.</p>

      <p>“Class, this is Jin Ling,” Wei Ying says. “He'll be joining us from now on. Please treat him nicely.”</p>

      <p>There are a few nods and noises of reassurance. Jin Ling still hasn't looked up.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying scans the classroom. He spots an empty seat next to Lan Sizhui, who seems to be one of the few people politely smiling at the new student, even if Jin Ling is adamant in focusing on his shoes instead.</p>

      <p>“Jin Ling, you can sit next to Lan Sizhui,” Wei Ying says, motioning towards the empty chair.</p>

      <p>Sizhui sits up straighter. Jin Ling trudges his way along to his new seat and Wei Ying watches for a second as Sizhui spares a few moments to introduce himself.</p>

      <p><em>He'll be fine</em>, Wei Ying thinks. Sizhui is one of the friendlier students out here.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, as the day drawls on and Wei Ying moves from class to class, he's once again reminded of how fast gossip finds its way around these students. By midday, he's already found out Jin Ling left his private school because he was being bullied. Of course, with news of Jin Ling coming from a rich and well known family, the rumours only got worse. Wei Ying had to tell his class to shut up before he was tempted to chuck his pen at the kid calling Jin Ling a stuck up mistress.</p>

      <p>High school truly is an ordeal. Wei Ying wonders why Jin Zixuan decided to bring Jin Ling here.</p>

      <p>As luck (or misfortune depending on how Wei Ying looks at the situation) would have it, Jin Ling's class is his last class to teach. With him only being their homeroom teacher, Wei Ying will often only see his students during the morning and lunch times. Today is not one of those days.</p>

      <p>It takes no expert to see Jin Ling is clearly uncomfortable being here. Wei Ying tries to focus on his lesson, but it's difficult to ignore the way Jin Ling shrinks into his books and makes no effort to talk to anyone at all, not even Lan Sizhui.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying tells himself it's because he's a teacher. He's concerned for the well-being of all his students. It's not because Jin Ling is supposed to be his nephew too, even if he is no longer part of their family. Even if he thinks this is all his fault Jin Ling is in this position to begin with.</p>

      <p>He's not supposed to be meddling with any of their family affairs anymore. Jiang Cheng will kill him—hell, <em>the guilt</em> will kill him if he opens up old wounds that aren't even closed yet.</p>

      <p>And yet, Wei Ying doesn't hesitate to walk after Jin Ling once class is over. The students head home. Jin Ling nearly drops all of his things rushing out of the room.</p>

      <p>“Jin Ling,” Wei Ying calls after him.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling throws a glare over his shoulder and walks faster. “Don't talk to me! I'm going!”</p>

      <p><em>“Jin Ling!”</em></p>

      <p>“No! Stay away! I don't want you anywhere near me!”</p>

      <p>He sure could walk fast, all the while making sure he <em>stomped</em> as loud as possible too. Wei Ying almost lets him go—but he's pretty sure Jin Zixuan is busy as usual and Jiang Cheng's shift hasn't finished yet.</p>

      <p>“Jin Ling, for goodness sake, do you even have anyone to take you home?”</p>

      <p>Jin Ling stops. He whirls around. His face is red and the sheer hatred in his eyes nearly makes Wei Ying flinch.</p>

      <p>“Why do you care?!” he yells again before running off.</p>

      <p>That's right, why does he even care? Why is Wei Ying even trying?</p>

      <p>He doesn't know the answer. Instead, he runs after the teenager and freezes right on the spot when he sees Jiang Cheng waiting outside.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling clings to his uncle, hiding behind his arm. He peeks out to send another scowl—not that it matters because Jiang Cheng's appearance is enough to tell Wei Ying he is unwelcome here. With Jiang Cheng beside him, it's not difficult to tell where Jin Ling has gotten his charming manners.</p>

      <p>It's been over ten years since that incident and Jiang Cheng still looks at him as if he is dirt. Wei Ying doesn't expect any less; he deserves this and more, but it doesn't stop it from hurting.</p>

      <p>His pride will say it's not hurt. Enough time has passed for it to stop hurting. Empty, maybe. Guilt, definitely.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying swallows the lump in his throat, taking a step back. Jiang Cheng's eyes follow his every move, narrowing.</p>

      <p>“Come on, Jin Ling,” he says, laying a hand on his nephew's back. “Let's get you out of here.”</p>

      <p><em>Away from him</em>, Jiang Cheng means to say. Wei Ying says nothing as they disappear into Jiang Cheng's car. Once they're gone, it's as if they were never there to being with. If only forgetting about the whole experience is easier.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying mentally hits himself for even chasing after Jin Ling to begin with. What the fuck did he think he was going to do? Comfort him? <em>Apologise?</em> What a joke.</p>

      <p>Sighing, he returns inside. The school is pretty much empty now with all the students practically diving out to leave as soon as they can. Wei Ying is no longer in the mood to remain here as well; he'll gather his things and go back to his dump of an apartment.</p>

      <p>Well, that's the plan. When he goes back inside the classroom, Lan Jingyi is sitting in his usual seat, twiddling his thumbs.</p>

      <p>“Teacher Wei, I have detention again, remember?” he says.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying scratches the back of his head. He's lost count of the amount of detentions he's given this kid.</p>

      <p>“Oh,” he says. “Oh yeah.”</p>

      <p>He takes one look at the clock and mentally groans. Jingyi has forty-five minutes left of detention. Looks like returning to his welcoming home will have to wait until later.</p>

      <p>His head is still reeling from the encounter with Jiang Cheng. He's distracted as he sits down and doesn't register the piece of paper left on his desk. Once his brain catches up, Wei Ying tilts his head and picks it up.</p>

      <p>It's a number; a phone number at that. Confused and slightly freaked out, Wei Ying looks around the classroom as if the answer will magically pop up in front of him.</p>

      <p>And it does. Jingyi is sitting there with the biggest shit-eating grin Wei Ying has ever seen in his life.</p>

      <p>“Lan Jingyi... What is this?” Wei Ying slowly asks.</p>

      <p>“It's Sizhui's dad's number!”</p>

      <p><em>For fuck sake.</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying gets a flashback to the awkward meeting he had with Sizhui's... <em>interesting</em> dad. Awkward may be a negative word to describe it, but how else can you describe meeting someone in town, only to end up having to bail their brother out of jail? Not only that, Mr. Lan in general is a strange man. Nice and attractive, yes, but strange. Wei Ying doesn't know how else to describe him. You don't really meet anyone here with waist-length hair, expensive clothes, and an inability to work his own phone.</p>

      <p>And so uptight! He shouldn't have expected any less from a parent who still gave their child a courtesy name in this day and age. Lan Jingyi has one too—in fact, his grandfather is so insistent they use his courtesy name instead that he didn't even bother revealing his birth name. Are all the Lans like this?</p>

      <p>Why is he even wondering?</p>

      <p>“Can you explain why this is on my desk?” Wei Ying waves the piece of paper around.</p>

      <p>He doesn't even want to look at it—surely there's some rules against students giving out random people's number to their teachers? <em>Surely?</em></p>

      <p>Jingyi shrugs but that grin on his face doesn't budge. Wei Ying has half a mind to scrunch the paper and fling it as his head.</p>

      <p>“Just thought you might like it,” Jingyi says.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying rubs the temples of his forehead. “Is this because we went for coffee together the other day?”</p>

      <p>Suddenly, the kid is alive. He jumps up in his seat and smacks the table with his palm.</p>

      <p><em>“You did?”</em></p>

      <p>Oh god. Wei Ying looks towards the clock again. Nope. Time is too slow. He doesn't have the patience for this today.</p>

      <p>“I—You know what, you can go home,” he says. He stands up and shoves everything back into his bag.</p>

      <p>“Eh?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying waves his arms. “Detention cancelled. Just make sure you get your essay done by tomorrow morning.”</p>

      <p>He's out of the classroom before Jingyi can say anything else. He doesn't know why he's on edge—or he does but he won't admit it.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling's appearance has made him remember things he'd rather not remember. Or think about things he <em>does</em> remember and can never forget, but chooses to avoid because he's nothing but a coward. That's it. That's it, isn't it? It's not just the fact that Jin Ling has gotten older and nothing has changed. <em>Nothing</em> has improved.</p>

      <p>The frigid air is actually welcoming as soon as he steps out of the school. He takes a deep breath.</p>

      <p>In the corner of his eyes, he sees Sizhui waiting by the school fence. His father is right next to him.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying ignores their eyes on him. Are they waiting for Jingyi?</p>

      <p>It doesn't matter. He heads for the opposite direction and leaves. He ignores the bus stop he usually waits in. He ignores his rumbling stomach and the fact he hasn't even eaten lunch yet, let alone dinner. He ignores his earlier wish of wanting to go home.</p>

      <p>The wind is cold as he makes his way towards the cemetery. He shoves his hands into his pockets, his thoughts too jumbled to really make sense of why he is going here in the first place. He's already seen Jin Ling and Jiang Cheng today; why is he making everything worse? Does he want to suffer more?</p>

      <p><em>Suffer.</em> Wei Ying has to scoff at that. <em>So dramatic.</em> He makes no sense when he's like this.</p>

      <p>His legs are moving automatically. He used to go here all the time, back when he thought he had the right to visit them. As the years passed, he has avoided it instead. It's been too long since he last set foot in this place.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's heart drops when he sees he is not the only one here. His fists tremble. Out of everyone, it's him. Out of all the times, he chooses now.</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan looks up, his eyes widening when he finally sees him. He's dressed entirely in black, fitting the atmosphere of the place. Wei Ying nearly turns around and leaves. His pride just won't let him.</p>

      <p>“You,” Jin Zixuan says. There's no hostility in his voice. He sounds tired.</p>

      <p>Somehow, Wei Ying finds his voice. “Sorry, I'll leave—”</p>

      <p>“No, you can stay if you want.” Jin Zixuan takes a step forward. “A-Li said she wanted to visit them, so I'm going for her.”</p>

      <p>Just one mention of her and Wei Ying's defences nearly crumble. He looks away and blinks as much as he can. The cold breeze is making his eyes sting. That's all.</p>

      <p>“Oh,” Wei Ying says. “How long will you be staying in Gusu?”</p>

      <p>“Just two days. I need to do some work back home then I'll fly back to America this weekend.”</p>

      <p>Two days. That's not nearly enough time to catch up with Jin Ling, especially with him having changed schools.</p>

      <p>But that's not Jin Zixuan's fault. It's not his fault he has to travel back and forth across the world, caring for a wife confined to her bed. Wei Ying heard the hospital they transferred Yanli to is one of the most advanced hospitals there is—so why hasn't there been any improvements?</p>

      <p>“How... is she?” he asks, still unable to look at the older man.</p>

      <p>“She's making progress.”</p>

      <p><em>Progress.</em> He says it like Wei Ying is supposed to know what that means. He wants to know every detail but he hasn't got the guts to beg for it. It's his fault this has happened in the first place.</p>

      <p>“Did you see A-Ling today?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying is thankful for the change in subject. He finally forces himself to look at Jin Zixuan, nodding.</p>

      <p>“Yes, he wasn't happy to see me. Didn't you know I worked at that school?”</p>

      <p>“I did.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying frowns. “Then... why?”</p>

      <p>It's Jin Zixuan's turn to glance away. He kneels down to tidy the flowers by the grave, caressing them so slow that Wei Ying wonders if he has heard his question.</p>

      <p>Then, he rises, patting down his trousers.</p>

      <p>“He was bullied in his last one. I figured you would take care of him if anything happened in this new school.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan is not like the stuck up child he used to be back in high school. When he fell in love with Yanli, his whole attitude changed—and for the better. Maybe it's just Wei Ying's bitterness that convinces him there is some blame hidden under his words.</p>

      <p>Take care of Jin Ling, because Jin Zixuan can't do it himself. He can't be there for his own son; he's too busy caring for a wife they don't know will ever recover. He's too busy juggling the remnants of his family along with his business to be there for a young teenager who just wants his mother. He's too busy trying to piece together a life Wei Ying has ripped apart.</p>

      <p>No, Jin Zixuan doesn't need to say it. Wei Ying already knows.</p>

      <p>He can only nod. He doesn't trust himself to say anything.</p>

      <p>“I take it Jiang Cheng saw you today as well.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's face flickers back in his mind. Twice, he had run into him during this past week. Too much.</p>

      <p>“You didn't tell him what school Jin Ling was going to beforehand?”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan's eyebrows twitch. “Did I need to? I'm A-Ling's father. I decide what school he goes to.”</p>

      <p>There it is. There's the Jin Zixuan that Wei Ying clearly remembers; the stuck up and stubborn air, except it's not a teenager showing off about his riches but a father trying to cling onto a son he barely sees.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying grits his teeth. “I should go.”</p>

      <p>Jin Zixuan quickly shakes his head. “No, stay. I'll go now. I've paid my respects but you haven't yet.”</p>

      <p>He is walking away before Wei Ying can stop him. Before he leaves, he lays a hand on his shoulder as he passes. Wei Ying can still feel the weight even when he is gone.</p>

      <p>It's too empty in this cemetery. Wei Ying turns to the two graves he came to see, not knowing what he can say to them now that he is left alone. Why did he come here? What does he hope to achieve?</p>

      <p>He kneels in front of them, admiring the lotus flowers Jin Zixuan has left. Wei Ying has nothing to offer. He can't even find the words to say.</p>

      <p>Silent, he looks over their names. <em>Jiang Fengmian. Yu Ziyuan.</em></p>

      <p>He wants to say he is sorry, but he can't make the words leave his mouth. Even now, he selfishly wonders if this was his fault as well. How could he have known? He never intended this to happen.</p>

      <p>In the end, Wei Ying doesn't say anything. He stares and stares at the lotus flowers and hates himself even more for being unable to think of something. Anything.</p>

      <p>He leaves.</p>

      <p>It's funny. He used to come here because it comforted him to be near his family. Maybe Jiang Cheng is right. Jiang Fengmian is no longer his father, and Yu Ziyuan never wanted him as a son to begin with. He shouldn't have come here in the first place.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>As soon as Wei Ying returns home, he grabs a bottle of wine from his cupboards. He's about to pour himself a whole glass when he decides this isn't enough. Instead, he roots through the dark cupboard and pulls out some vodka. He doesn't bother with the glass and drinks straight out the bottle instead, grimacing at the taste that explodes in his mouth.</p>

      <p>He hasn't missed the taste of vodka at all, but at least it takes his mind off things.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying lets himself fall back on his couch, closing his eyes. He shoves his hands into his coat pockets, trying to find his keys before he forgets about them as usual.</p>

      <p>He finds his phone first. After quickly checking his messages, he sees that only Wen Qing has texted him today.</p>

      <div class="phone">
        <p class="messagebody">
          <span class="header">Wen-Qing</span><br /><br />
          <span class="time"><b>Today</b> 4:13 PM</span><br />
          <span class="text">wanna come round later? wen-ning's bringing pizza xxx</span><br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Wei Ying quickly types up a reply.</p>

      <div class="phone-no-header">
        <p class="messagebody-no-header">
          <span class="time"><b>Today</b> 6:25 PM</span><br />
          <span class="breply">not today sorry 😔 maybe friday night at mine instead?</span><br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Her reply is scarily instant. He spares a smile as he reads through it.</p>

      <div class="phone-no-header">
        <p class="messagebody-no-header">
          <span class="text">no pizza for you then 🖕🏻</span><br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>He puts aside his phone and roots through his other pocket.</p>

      <p>Huh? Paper?</p>

      <p>Pulling it out, Wei Ying groans as soon as he remembers the number Jingyi has <em>kindly</em> given him. It's all crumpled from being in Wei Ying's pocket all afternoon but he can see the number clear as day.</p>

      <p>Part of him is tempted. Very tempted. If this had been five years ago, he would have jumped at any chance to distract himself with someone. Anything to take his mind off things, anything to make him feel <em>something</em> other than this guilt.</p>

      <p>His eyes read through the number. Mr. Lan seems like a nice enough man. Not only is he handsome but he also looks like he's got an impressive bank account. Of course, Wei Ying doesn't give a shit about anyone's wealth—he's not like <em>that</em>. If they're rich, they're rich. If they're handsome, they're handsome. If they're there, they're there. He's long decided not to get attached to people. Details don't really matter.</p>

      <p>That was then, and this is now. Wei Ying is tired. He's played around with too many men and women to know that nothing will ever change. No matter how many dates he goes on, no matter how many people he sleeps with, it doesn't change the fact it means nothing. He's always felt he doesn't deserve anyone's love or affection, so why should it matter to him? Love exists for people like Jiejie; people who are good and deserve better.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying swings back the bottle again, shutting up his sentimental thoughts with the overwhelming taste of vodka. He takes one last look at Mr. Lan's number before he crumples it up into his fist and throws it away to the corner of his room.</p>
