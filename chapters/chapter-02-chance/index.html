    <h2>T W O</h2>
    <h3>Chance</h3>

    <div class="fic-text">
      <p>His brother was right in saying that Jingyi's enthusiasm is his greatest trait. However, when the teenager declares he's managed to learn something on the piano, Wangji is not sure what to expect. He has not brought his Playing Station for today's lesson, which is an improvement, but the way he grins up at Wangji while saying he's got something that will 'blow his socks off' is not very reassuring.</p>

      <p>“Go,” Wangji says, sitting back and folding his arms.</p>

      <p>Jingyi's eyes practically sparkle. He sits up straighter and begins to play.</p>

      <p>After two seconds, Wangji is already staring off into space and trying to remember if the original Lan Jingyi was this hopeless when it came to music. His eyes narrow at the way Jingyi only uses two fingers, starting from the middle of the piano and then making his way to the other keys from both sides.</p>

      <p>“I gave you Beethoven to learn,” Wangji sighs. “Not this.”</p>

      <p>“That was too hard!” Jingyi says. “But I searched on YouTube and found some beginner songs! Chopsticks is a good start!”</p>

      <p>Wangji does not know what in the world he is talking about, much less where he is actually searching to find these songs. He repeats his brother's advice; enthusiasm is Jingyi's greatest trait. This, in a way, can count as enthusiasm if he is clutching at straws.</p>

      <p>“Hmm.” He reaches for his music sheets and tries to find something easier to start with. “We will go through the basics again.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi sits up straighter again, watching as Wangji's fingers run over the piano's keys. A smile remains on his face and he's not as distracted as he had been for his past lessons. There is progress—small progress, but progress nonetheless.</p>

      <p>Sizhui joins them after Jingyi's one hour lesson is finished, carrying a tray of hot drinks. Coffee for Wangji, tea for Sizhui, and hot chocolate with marshmallows for Jingyi.</p>

      <p>Wangji takes this moment to relax. The two teenagers lounge on the couch, each hugging a cushion to their chest as they wait for their drinks to cool down. Jingyi is picking at the marshmallows, happily chewing on them.</p>

      <p>“Jingyi, you said you were coming here yesterday afternoon,” Sizhui says, taking a marshmallow for himself. “Where were you?”</p>

      <p>“Had detention with Teacher Wei again...” Jingyi mutters. Wangji's eyes flicker to him. “It's not so bad though. He's cool.”</p>

      <p>“You didn't do the homework <em>again</em>?”</p>

      <p>Jingyi gives a nervous laugh, shrugging. “He just made me do it after school instead.”</p>

      <p>“You're lucky he's nice.”</p>

      <p>Wangji looks away, staring into his coffee instead. It has been almost a week since he saw Wei Ying. He's gone through every scenario in his head as to how he can talk to the teacher again but it is only now he realises it was Wei Ying who only ever approached <em>him</em>. Now with this newly reincarnated Wei Ying, the chances of him approaching Wangji first is close to none.</p>

      <p>He drinks more of his coffee until the phone rings. No one calls Wangji, much less call the house phone. Already knowing who it is, Wangji leaves the living room to pick it up. As expected, it is Xichen.</p>

      <p>“How are you, Wangji?”</p>

      <p>There is the sound of other people in the background from the other side. It is hard to tell what they're saying but he knows Xichen is in public, to say the least.</p>

      <p>“I am well,” Wangji says.</p>

      <p>“Have you spoken with Wei Wuxian?”</p>

      <p>His brother needs to stop reading his emotions, even from the other side of the world. He frowns, turning away from the sight of Jingyi and Sizhui.</p>

      <p>“No.”</p>

      <p>“Do you intend to?"</p>

      <p>“It is... difficult.”</p>

      <p>Wangji even took Sizhui to school one day, hoping to see Wei Ying before he had to leave. Unfortunately, he was nowhere in sight and Sizhui began to look at him strangely for refusing to let him go inside the school until Wei Ying appeared.</p>

      <p>“Hmm... I am not quite experienced in modern methods of courting,” Xichen mutters. “He has always been eager to talk to you back then, though.”</p>

      <p><em>Back then.</em> That was back then. Wangji wants to tell his brother, but he knows Xichen is only trying to encourage and help him. He will get nowhere if he continues to do nothing about this.</p>

      <p>Even so, if Xichen is clueless when it comes to modern courting, then there is no hope at all for Wangji.</p>

      <p>He has never given much thought to courting, not when the only person he wanted was nowhere in reach for all these years. The desire and <em>need</em> almost drove him insane for the first few centuries but not once did the thought of satisfying himself with someone else cross Wangji's mind. If Wei Ying isn't involved then there is nothing.</p>

      <p>As for Xichen... Wangji does not know. His brother disappears too often for him to grasp what he is doing. He once thought that Xichen's relationship with his sworn brothers had been more than what they showed on the surface, but he was not one to pry. The topic of Nie Mingjue and Jin Guangyao was too much a wound that Wangji never dared to bring up.</p>

      <p>“I will think on it,” he says in the end, even if thinking about it is the only thing he has managed to do for the past week.</p>

      <p>“When will you arrive here?” Wangji asks.</p>

      <p>“I will arrive there around midday tomorrow. May I join you for dinner then?”</p>

      <p>“Will you not be tired?”</p>

      <p>“I should survive well enough for dinner with you and Sizhui.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. Are you at the airport now?” Wangji can still hear the sound of people in the background.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I will not be taking the plane,” Xichen slowly says. “I will be flying there myself.”</p>

      <p>Wangji frowns.</p>

      <p>“You know how much I detest public transport.”</p>

      <p>He gets a flashback of Xichen expressing his rare opinion on a flight he took to London once. Apparently, Xichen spent the whole twelve hours sat next to a screaming baby that even his benevolent patience was stretched thin. Suffice to say his brother had been hesitant to venture into public transport since that incident, regardless of how many times Wangji reminds him he can pay for first class instead.</p>

      <p>It must have been a very loud child, Wangji thinks. His brother has always been the epitome of patience.</p>

      <p>“Be careful not to be seen,” Wangji says, although he knows it is not needed. Xichen is more than capable of this.</p>

      <p>“Of course. I will call you when I am back,” Xichen reassures. “Is Sizhui there?”</p>

      <p>Wangji looks up and sees the teenager laughing at something Jingyi has said. “Yes. Do you wish to speak with him?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, please. I have not spoken to him in too long.”</p>

      <p>He says his farewells and gives the phone to Sizhui, allowing a small smile to tug up his lips at how enthusiastic the teenager sounds talking to his uncle. With Sizhui's attention diverted, Jingyi sits back on the couch and looks around the room with obvious boredom. Wangji tries to ignore it when the child's eyes finally rest on him.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Uncle,” he says. “Do you not have a girlfriend yet?”</p>

      <p>Wangji resists the urge to scowl. “No.”</p>

      <p>“You should get a Tinder account if you wanna look for dates,” Jingyi says, completely oblivious to Wangji's cold aura.</p>

      <p>“Timber?”</p>

      <p>“No,” Jingyi sighs as if he is talking to a child. “<em>Tinder</em>. It's a dating app.”</p>

      <p>Wangji keeps his mouth shut. He does not even know what an app is supposed to be.</p>

      <p>“Here, if you give me your phone, I'll make an account for you.” Jingyi shuffles closer to him on the couch.</p>

      <p>Wangji does not know what possesses him to reach for his own phone. Jingyi's stubbornness is futile to fight.</p>

      <p>“What. Is that.” Jingyi's eyes widen. “Is that... Is that a <em>Nokia</em>?”</p>

      <p>He says the word as if it is cursed relic, continuing to stare at Wangji's phone in shock.</p>

      <p>“Uncle, how are you so rich and yet you own a phone that's probably older than <em>me?</em>” Jingyi cries. He clings onto Sizhui's arm and shakes him until the other sends him a suffering look. “Sizhui, how can you let your dad own a brick?”</p>

      <p>“Sorry, Uncle Xichen—hang on, Jingyi!” Sizhui turns away from the phone and looks between them. “Oh. Dad barely uses his phone anyway.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, but how is he supposed to get Tinder!”</p>

      <p>Sizhui shrugs helplessly. “I don't think... I don't think he'd be the type to go on Tinder...”</p>

      <p>“Don't tell me Uncle Xichen has a brick too...”</p>

      <p>Sizhui turns back to the phone, his eyebrows raising. “No, he says he has a Samsung S9.”</p>

      <p>Jingyi's lip curls. “Samsung... That's even worse.”</p>

      <p>“Okay, Uncle Wangji!” Jingyi pushes away Wangji's phone. There is determination on his face. “Please buy a better phone! Honestly, no one uses these things anymore. I'm surprised it still works.”</p>

      <p>Wangji puts his phone back in his pocket, shaking his head. He only uses it to call Sizhui when it is needed, which is rare. Sizhui is a mature and capable teenager who does not need a parent to be checking up on him every five minutes. Xichen, on the other hand, will mainly call the house phone because he knows there is more chance that will be picked up instead.</p>

      <p>“Unnecessary,” he says.</p>

      <p>“But what about Tinder!” Jingyi insists. “It'll help you with your love life, I swear.”</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes narrow. He cares little for dating girls, or however Jingyi phrased it, but part of him wonders if this Timber will help him approach Wei Ying. How will it even work?</p>

      <p>He glances back at Jingyi. Listening to this teenager will only be the beginning of tragedy. Wangji shakes his head once again and refuses to acknowledge any more of this nonsense.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The next day, he somehow ends up buying a new phone anyway. With no lessons to distract him, Wangji ventured into the city and entered the nearest shop he could find that had these phones on display. The shopping assistant looked a bit confused when he asked for a phone that had Timber in it but nevertheless directed him to one of their newer models.</p>

      <p>With Wangji's limited knowledge in modern technology, the assistant had to help him with various things. A few hours must have passed until she declared he could use his phone starting from the moment he left the shop, having already installed every application he needed and moved all of his old contacts from his old phone to his new one. She seemed quite thankful he only had a total of four people in his contact list.</p>

      <p>He thanked her, leaving the shop with the new phone and even more questions. The name on the box that came with it said <em>iPhone</em>, but that name meant nothing to Wangji.</p>

      <p>He was more confused as to where the buttons were. The lady in the shop was commanding the phone to do all sorts of things without pressing anything. For a second, Wangji wondered if this was another form of cultivation.</p>

      <p>Sighing, he decides he will have to ask Sizhui instead. He has already burdened that assistant enough.</p>

      <p>It is still only morning. He has already finished shopping for dinner later tonight, remembering the dishes his brother liked to eat. The city is busy, even at this time, but it's to be expected during the weekend. How strange that Gusu used to be a place of tranquil and seclusion, and now it has morphed into a bustling city.</p>

      <p>Memories of each clan slowly declining are still fresh on Wangji's mind. First, the attack at Qinghe Nie Sect that left its last surviving leader dead; the scandal that followed once it was revealed who was responsible; his brother's heart breaking when he took it upon himself to settle this age-old betrayal.</p>

      <p>Then, the tragedy that befell both sect leaders of Yunmeng Jiang and Lanling Jin. To this day, details of the event are still unclear, with fact and rumours mixing to create a story that Wangji knows may not even be accurate. Yunmeng Jiang and Lanling Jin tried their best to persevere with new leaders, clinging onto their own ideals and refusing to give up hundreds of years of history. Unfortunately, with uncertainty of the future came conflict, and it was not long until those two clans fell to their own demise.</p>

      <p>In the end, only Gusu Lan Sect remained from the larger clans, but even then, the years passed and people moved on. They sought other ways of living, abandoning spiritual goals for materialistic ones. Cultivation was soon forgotten, only remembered in stories and myths. What was once a lifelong goal for people became nothing but a fairy tale.</p>

      <p>Wangji has watched the seasons come and go. He has seen the world transform before his very eyes, how humanity has fallen and risen, only to fall again and again. He has seen wars tear apart countries and threaten to bring upon the apocalypse, and he has even hoped for them. Dying along with the rest of the world seemed like a fitting way to go. Then, he would not feel guilty for giving up on Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>Now, he looks around the city again. For someone who has seen everything, there is nothing here that captivates him—</p>

      <p>And then his eyes catch on a distant figure, struggling to keep hold of the grocery bags he is carrying in both hands.</p>

      <p>Before he knows it, Wangji's legs are already moving.</p>

      <p>“Mr. Lan!” Wei Ying jumps. He grumbles under his breath and places the plastic bags on the ground. “Hello again.”</p>

      <p>Today, his hair is loose, with one side tucked behind his ear. Wangji sees it is secured with a clip and his heart cannot help but flip over at this. He is wearing a red turtle-neck jumper that hugs his figure—a big difference to the loose robes Wangji has always seen him in. His black jeans are also tight, ripped at the knees. Why Wei Ying is still wearing torn clothing is a mystery to him. Wangji has half a mind to take his coat off and throw it on him just to cover him up.</p>

      <p>He looks away, for the sake of his own sanity.</p>

      <p>Wangji nods at the plastic bags. “Are you struggling?”</p>

      <p>“No.” With that, Wei Ying gathers them into his hands again. A small noise escapes him when he picks them back up. “Well, yes, but you don't have to look at me like that.”</p>

      <p>“Give them to me.”</p>

      <p>“Eh, do you go around asking people for their stuff? Mr. Lan, that's rude. These are mine.”</p>

      <p>Wangji takes a deep breath through his nose. “No—I meant, I will carry them.”</p>

      <p>“That desperate to be a gentleman?” He points at the plastic bags Wangji is carrying himself. “You're already carrying something.”</p>

      <p>“I can manage.”</p>

      <p>“But I need to go home. Are you going to carry them for me all the way there?”</p>

      <p>“I can bring you home.”</p>

      <p>“Wow. Again?”</p>

      <p>Wangji nods.</p>

      <p>“Are you a taxi driver or something?”</p>

      <p>“No,” Wangji says. "Enough questions.”</p>

      <p>This time, Wei Ying laughs, shaking his head to himself. He looks at Wangji up and down. “Alright, fine. Don't complain if they're too heavy for you.”</p>

      <p>Of course, they are not. Wangji picks all five bags with ease, carrying them in his right hand and watching as Wei Ying's smile is replaced by an unhappy pout.</p>

      <p>“Okay, now you're just showing off, Mr. Lan,” he says. The little scowl he throws Wangji is filled with no malice. If anything, it only makes Wangji's heart beat faster.</p>

      <p>They walk side by side. It is ridiculous that memories Wangji thought were long dead are reawakening this very moment. Back then, they had once walked around Yiling town like this, when Sizhui was still Wen Yuan and Wei Ying was the infamous Patriarch. He finds he likes looking at their reflection on the windows they pass. Seeing Wei Ying by his side again makes his steps feel lighter.</p>

      <p>“Hey, let me treat you to a drink,” Wei Ying says, suddenly stopping.</p>

      <p>He motions towards a café on the corner of the street called <em>The Hidden Forest.</em> It seems acceptable enough but the welcome sign has <em>'We've bean expecting you'</em> written in English.</p>

      <p>“I made my friend put up that sign,” Wei Ying explains when Wangji spends the next few seconds staring at the cursed sign. “I laugh at it every time.”</p>

      <p>Wangji keeps his thoughts to himself. Laughing is the last thing he wants to do.</p>

      <p>“Come on, don't look at me like you're dead inside!” Wei Ying nudges his side with his elbow and runs off to open the door before Wangji can even react.</p>

      <p>The smell of coffee and cakes fill his nose as soon as he steps in. He takes a deep breath of it, glancing around. Despite its horrid welcome sign, the inside has a peaceful and homely atmosphere. If Wangji were to compare the interior with something, then he would pick a cottage. The walls are designed so they look wooden, and the windows are round with fake ivy and plants entwining around them. There are small lights dangling from the ceiling, giving the illusion this place is surrounded by fireflies.</p>

      <p>“S-Sir!”</p>

      <p>By the counter is a face Wangji has not seen in a while. Wen Ning.</p>

      <p>He is as skittish as ever, fiddling with the cloth in front of him. It is odd to see him alive and not in the form of a zombie the Yiling Patriarch is commanding. His hair is short now, although the strand that curls down his forehead is still there. He gives Wei Ying a nervous smile as he approaches the counter.</p>

      <p>“Would you like your usual order...?” Wen Ning asks.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying nods. “Yeah, and for you to stop calling me 'sir'. We're friends.”</p>

      <p>“But I'm at work!”</p>

      <p>“You still call me that when I'm at your house!”</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes narrow. Why would Wei Ying be in another man's house? His hands grip the plastic bags tighter and suddenly Wen Ning's smile does not look so friendly anymore.</p>

      <p>“O-Okay, Wei... Wei Ying. And um...” Wen Ning's voice trails off as he stares at Wangji, flinching. Wangji looks away, not realising he has started to scowl.</p>

      <p>“What... What about your, um, friend?” Wen Ning asks. Every word he says sounds like he is in pain.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying, as expected, is unaware of anything. “Mr. Lan, what would you like?”</p>

      <p><em>For him to leave</em>, Wangji thinks.</p>

      <p>“Black coffee,” he says instead.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's nose scrunches up. “Disgusting. There you go, Wen Ning, he wants that. I'll pay for both.”</p>

      <p>Wen Ning all but runs off to make their orders. Wei Ying pays for their drinks and sends a blinding smile towards his friend, making Wangji's guts churn around. He has not missed this feeling of jealousy at all.</p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Wangji says when they are sat down.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sits down opposite him, blowing on his cup of coffee before taking a tiny sip. Wangji notices there are tiny red flakes floating on it. He dares to think they might be chilli flakes but surely Wei Ying does not like his coffee to be spicy as well...</p>

      <p>“It's the least I can do,” Wei Ying says, taking another sip. He keeps tucking his hair behind his ear, even when one side is already clipped back.</p>

      <p>With Wei Ying literally in front of him, Wangji can barely focus on the bitter taste of his own drink. He cannot help but sneak glances at him every second, admiring the gentle slope of his nose, the way his eyelashes are cast down when he drinks his coffee, anything. Everything. With his hair being shoulder-length rather than down to his waist, Wangji is forever staring at it, as if trying to imprint the changes in his brain. It is not a bad change.</p>

      <p>Then again, Wei Ying could have a completely difference face and Wangji would not even blink.</p>

      <p>“So,” Wei Ying says. He places his coffee on the table. “Sizhui told me he used to live in London. Were you two born there?”</p>

      <p>Wangji shakes his head. “Sizhui was. I was born in Gusu.”</p>

      <p>“So you met your wife in London?”</p>

      <p>“No,” Wangji frowns. “I don't have a wife.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?” For some reason, Wei Ying looks shocked. He sits back and stares at Wangji long enough for him to wonder what in the world he is thinking.</p>

      <p>“I... adopted Sizhui,” he says, after a while of painful silence.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying slowly nods. “Sorry for prying.”</p>

      <p>It is Wangji's turn to stare. He has a question too, but he is not sure he wants to know the answer.</p>

      <p>“Do you... have a wife?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying looks away. He grabs his coffee and takes another sip, his actions too slow for Wangji's liking. “No. I've been with a few people but it was never anything serious.”</p>

      <p>Although he feels relief that Wei Ying is not yet married, he still catches onto the fact he has had previous relationships. Suddenly, Wangji's coffee is much more bitter than it already is.</p>

      <p>He does not want to think of Wei Ying being with someone else, and yet he also does not want to deny him of happiness. It is a frustrating battle between his own selfish desires and his love for this oblivious man in front of him. Wangji takes another gulp and tries to focus on the taste instead of his thoughts.</p>

      <p>“Were you born here?” he asks, eager to change the subject.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head. “I was born in Yunmeng, but moved to Gusu for university and stayed here ever since.”</p>

      <p>Wangji notices the way he speaks faster. His eyes are fixed on the table and he doesn't elaborate.</p>

      <p>Is he still with the Jiang family? Wangji wants to know. This burning curiosity is maddening.</p>

      <p>“It's not bad here though. I like teaching.”</p>

      <p>It seems they are both keen to change the topic with these questions.</p>

      <p>“Sizhui said you were his favourite teacher,” Wangji says.</p>

      <p>“Aaw, how sweet. Are you only saying this so I'll bump your son's grades up?”</p>

      <p><em>“No.”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying lets out a laugh that lasts too short. He tries to tuck his hair behind his ear again, grasping on nothing because it is already clipped back.</p>

      <p>“Not like he needs it anyway,” he says. “He's one of my best students. Looking at you, I can see why he's so well behaved.”</p>

      <p>“Looking at me?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying nods. He waves a hand in Wangji's direction as if the answer is clear.</p>

      <p>“You seem like you're really uptight and strict. I bet you are. If you were a teacher and I was a student, you'd have hated me.”</p>

      <p>He laughs again. This time, it sounds a bit more genuine. Wangji allows himself to smile when Wei Ying isn't looking.</p>

      <p>“Why is that?”</p>

      <p>Resting his chin on his palm, Wei Ying doesn't say anything for a while. He then shrugs, brightness in his grey eyes.</p>

      <p>“A lot of my teachers hated me back then. They said I talked too much and didn't take the work seriously.”</p>

      <p>That sounds very likely. Even with the new hair and clothes, Wei Ying is still the same. Wangji lets out a soft 'hmm' and finishes his coffee, uncaring that it has already gone cold. With Wei Ying smiling in front of him, his chest feels warm enough.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Lan Xichen is not sure if he wants to return to Gusu. Too many bad memories lay in that place—although it is not as if the memories ever leave him no matter what country he decides to run away to next. He can hide himself away in a secluded forest, a place where no one will think exists, and the nightmares will still haunt him every night.</p>

      <p>Gusu is the worst place for him, or anywhere in this country for that matter. Xichen liked how busy and cluttered London was for a while; it helped to distract him from his thoughts and the endless guilt. The first few years he spent in London were a nice change but a change can only last so long. Soon, the crowds became suffocating and their noise only reminded him of his own screams during the night.</p>

      <p>If he ever tried to find a quiet place to calm himself down, the silence would steer his mind towards <em>them.</em> If he was amidst a crowd, it would not be long until the faces morphed into <em>them.</em></p>

      <p>And so, Xichen has decided long ago there really is no place for him in this world.</p>

      <p>Regardless, he's already close to his destination and he promised Wangji he would join him and Sizhui for dinner tonight. Shrouded in the clouds, he can <em>feel</em> the familiar embrace of a home he once felt safe in. Xichen made sure to keep himself hidden as he got nearer and nearer the land, letting the breeze calm his mind.</p>

      <p>He is home. As much as this place has stopped feeling like it, he is still home.</p>

      <p>As soon as his feet touch the ground, he can't help but shiver. Being back in here feels as if his sworn brothers' spirits are closer. It is difficult to tell if that is comforting or not.</p>

      <p>He has landed in a forest. There is no one around, not so deep in a place like this. He breathes in the air he has not breathed in for too long and takes a look around. The sky is clear and blindingly blue, no speck of clouds to be seen.</p>

      <p>Xichen looks down at his sword and catches a glimpse of himself on the blade. He has not aged a day since he became immortal... and that was how many years ago? Over two thousand? After the first century, he has stopped counting. Both he and Wangji are forever frozen to look like they are in their mid-thirties but the fact they have lived for over two thousand years is just... tiring to think about. The heavens are truly cruel.</p>

      <p>He sighs. Now is not the time to be brooding. Xichen opens his Qiankun bag for his sword to go in.</p>

      <p>A branch snaps behind him.</p>

      <p>Xichen whirls around and sees wide, blue eyes. They stare at him in shock and the breeze stops for a second as the two stand frozen in front of each other. This face is familiar, although it is a face he has never interacted with much outside of formality and business. It is a face he only knows had gotten shrouded with hatred and anger through the years, after having lost everything and everyone. Xichen can relate to that, in a way.</p>

      <p>Sandu Shengshou. Jiang Wanyin. Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>He has seen glimpses of this man over the centuries, his other incarnations passing by like forgotten shadows. This is the closest Xichen has ever been. He is scowling, his eyes alive with the only emotion Xichen has only ever seen on him. His hair is no longer in a bun; it is much shorter, only reaching his chin. It is parted and his bangs are unruly as they are swept over the right side of his face.</p>

      <p>He remembers the rumours surrounding the original Jiang Cheng's demise. He spent so many years engulfed in his hatred for Wei Wuxian, for a man who never came back to satisfy that bloodthirst. His endless vengeance was his own downfall. Many said he died in a night hunting accident, some speculated it was Qi Deviation. Others said he took his own life, just because everything was too much. Or too empty.</p>

      <p>“Put. The. Weapon. Down.”</p>

      <p>His voice snaps Xichen out of it.</p>

      <p>He is suddenly very much aware of what is happening right now.</p>

      <p>His sword is still in his hand. He is in the middle of nowhere. And Jiang Cheng is wearing a uniform that can only belong to the police. Within seconds, Xichen is staring into the barrel of a gun and he is not sure what to really do. Jiang Cheng is yelling something but Xichen is transporting into another plane of existence, one where he isn't <em>stupid</em> enough to be brandishing a sword in public.</p>

      <p>“I said put the weapon down!”</p>

      <p>Not knowing what else he <em>can</em> do, Xichen slowly lowers Shuoyue on the ground. The thought of using cultivation to make his escape crosses his mind. Xichen decides against it. He does not want to attack Jiang Cheng, even if he is still pointing that gun at his face.</p>

      <p>“I'm arresting you for illegal possession of dangerous weapons!”</p>

      <p>Arrested. Xichen is literally at a loss for words. Never in his long, long, <em>long</em> existence has he ever had something like this happen to him. The shock of how ridiculous this situation is renders him speechless and he does nothing as Jiang Cheng handcuffs and pushes him out of the forest.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng grabs his sword before they leave, handling it as if it is a bomb about to explode. He is a little amused at the comparison of the younger man being a police, hunting down all of the criminals similarly to how he hunted down demonic cultivators.</p>

      <p>The irony would be funny if Xichen isn't currently being driven to the police station.</p>

      <p>Everything is a blur from there. He lets Jiang Cheng drag him inside, trying not to pay attention to all the other officers oggling the sword. Xichen will have to find a way to get Shuoyue back... No doubt they will confiscate it.</p>

      <p>They enter a room which Xichen guesses is where the Chief must be. He is as calm as ever, and then his heart drops at the sight of <em>who</em> the Chief is.</p>

      <p>It feels as if he has been kicked in the ribs. Xichen's fists clench under his handcuffs and his eyes sting. He does not know whether to cry or to laugh, to suffer or to celebrate.</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue had always glared at everyone as if they wronged him. Xichen considered himself lucky that his sworn brother often smiled at him, granting him the rare sight of the unknown tenderness behind his brawn. Now, he looks at him as he looks at everyone else. The older man folds his arms, thick eyebrows furrowing at Xichen as he diverts his gaze between him and the sword Jiang Cheng held.</p>

      <p>He no longer had his ponytail. Instead, Nie Mingjue's hair is cut short at the nape, his eyebrows as angry as ever. Xichen's heart is aching. He swallows the lump in his throat and gazes down at his shoes instead.</p>

      <p>“Another arrest?” Nie Mingjue grumbles. “I told you; you don't need to arrest someone if they're speeding.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng vehemently shakes his head. “No, I found him in the forest with <em>this</em> weapon.”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue's eyebrows raise. He regards Shuoyue and glances back at Xichen. At least he does not have to stare at him suffering from Qi Deviation, Xichen decides. Too many nights he has seen his sworn brother dying in front of his eyes. This other version of Nie Mingjue in front of him is more than welcome.</p>

      <p>“Explain yourself!” Nie Mingjue orders. His voice is throwing Xichen back thousands of years.</p>

      <p>It is a miracle he finds his voice at all. “I was practising my sword wielding skills. The forest helps me to be... one with myself.”</p>

      <p>“You're lying!” Jiang Cheng snaps.</p>

      <p>Xichen turns to the younger man and keeps his gaze steady. His face looks no different than when he was a sect leader. The only difference is that instead of Zidian, he now has a gun. Thankfully, he is no longer pointing it at his face.</p>

      <p>“I can assure you, Officer, that I meant no harm,” he calmly says. “The sword is an ancient family heirloom of mine. Forgive me, I do not normally live here in this country and forgot there were laws against using such a weapon in public.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's eyes narrow. “How can you <em>forget</em> that you can't be swinging around swords in public!”</p>

      <p>“In my defence, I was in a secluded forest and did not think anyone would be walking in to risk their safety...”</p>

      <p>Not just anyone too, but Jiang Cheng's incarnation who happened to be a police officer... Xichen's luck is truly horrendous.</p>

      <p>“That doesn't excuse anything!”</p>

      <p>“It is not an excuse. I am merely telling the truth—”</p>

      <p>“You say you were sword training but you're wearing a suit!” Jiang Cheng motions at his attire, waving his hand wildly. “How are we to know you weren't trying to smuggle weapons instead!”</p>

      <p>Xichen has to sigh. He wonders if every demonic cultivator has been interrogated like this by the insistent former sect leader.</p>

      <p>“I can tell you nothing but the truth. I would never willingly hurt anyone or <em>smuggle</em> weapons, as you put it.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng makes a noise that tells Xichen he believes none of the words that came out of his mouth. Giving up, Xichen turns to Nie Mingjue instead and waits with baited breath. Nie Mingjue had always had a strong sense of justice, perhaps <em>too</em> much. To him, everything was black and white with nothing in between. Their youngest sworn brother struggled endlessly to win his good graces back, and failed until the end.</p>

      <p><em>But Mingjue-xiong was right all along</em>, Xichen's thoughts claw in his head. <em>You believed all of A-Yao's lies and too many died because of your ignorance.</em></p>

      <p>Xichen grits his teeth. He keeps his eyes on Nie Mingjue and tries his best to ignore his thoughts, no matter how painfully correct they are.</p>

      <p>“You're both giving me a headache,” Nie Mingjue grumbles. He has that scowl he always keeps on his face but it falters for a second when he returns Xichen's gaze.</p>

      <p>Xichen does not move. Part of him wishes there is recognition there but he knows he does not deserve to reconcile with his sworn brothers. He looks away, steadying his shaking fists.</p>

      <p>“He doesn't look like he's lying,” Nie Mingjue says. “Just confiscate the damn sword and give him a fine!”</p>

      <p>Xichen fails to hide the surprise on his face. He was certain Nie Mingjue would damn him, treating him with the same conviction he placed on anyone who was not 'good' in his eyes.</p>

      <p>Jin Guangyao's voice rings in his ears.</p>

      <p><em>Da-ge always listens to you. He will glare at anyone and everyone but he'll always smile at you. He used to smile at me like that too; why does he hate me now?</em></p>

      <p>This police station is beginning to suffocate him. He really should not have returned to Gusu.</p>

      <p>“Yes, Chief Nie,” Jiang Cheng says.</p>

      <p>Xichen is all too happy to follow him out of the room, releasing a deep breath he did not realise he had been holding. He trails after Jiang Cheng as he leads them back to the front of the police station.</p>

      <p>“You're lucky Chief Nie went easy on you,” Jiang Cheng says, obviously unhappy.</p>

      <p>The fortunate thing is that Jiang Cheng is not a sect leader in this lifetime. He is only a lower ranking officer, it seems, and therefore has to follow his Chief's orders. He does not look pleased at all as he gives Xichen his fine.</p>

      <p>“Just pay it now and go,” he snaps, tapping his feet on the floor. “We'll be keeping hold of this.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng weighs Shuoyue in his hands. It's odd seeing his sword in someone else's possession. Xichen does not like it at all.</p>

      <p>“Now?” Xichen asks.</p>

      <p>“Yes. Now.”</p>

      <p>Ah.</p>

      <p>Wangji looks around the busy police station. Jiang Cheng is still in front of him, watching his every move. Paying the fine might be a bit difficult, when his wallet is in his suitcase... which is currently in his Qiankun bag; a magical bag that is only the size of a pouch small enough to be in his pocket. Pulling a suitcase out of a pouch in public is not a good idea at all. Even he knows that.</p>

      <p><em>“What?”</em> Jiang Cheng's voice rises. “What is it?”</p>

      <p>“Ah. I don't have money with me at the moment.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng may as well have burst a vein. <em>“Do you want to go to jail?!”</em></p>

      <p>Xichen closes his eyes and takes a deep, deep, <em>deep</em> breath. With the amount of deep breaths he has taken here, he may as well be meditating. It is barely twelve thirty in the afternoon and he already wishes today will end. Jiang Cheng's own impatience is beginning to affect him.</p>

      <p>“Have you got a phone?” he asks, keeping his voice steady. He raises his handcuffed hands. “My brother can pay the fine. I will need you to take these off though.”</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Wangji's phone rings and he is faced with the impossible task of trying to unlock it. He fumbles with the device and searches for the buttons. The old phone Jingyi described as a brick was easier to handle than this flimsy piece of metal.</p>

      <p>Two minutes must have passed and the phone is still ringing.</p>

      <p>“You okay?” Wei Ying asks, tilting his head. “Forgot your password?”</p>

      <p>“No,” Wangji says. “The buttons.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean buttons?”</p>

      <p>“Where are they?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's frown deepens. After watching him struggle for another minute, the teacher reaches over the desk and takes the phone from his hands. Wangji flinches when their hands brush, snatching his away before he can stop himself.</p>

      <p>“It's not even locked,” Wei Ying says. He swipes his finger on the screen and then pokes it. “Oh, it's an unknown number. Wanna answer it?”</p>

      <p>“Fine.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying presses the screen again and hands the phone back to him. He watches with large eyes, sipping on his coffee.</p>

      <p>“Wangji?” It is Xichen. His voice sounds a bit strained.</p>

      <p>“Brother, what is it?”</p>

      <p>“I may need your help.”</p>

      <p>Wangji sits up. It is rare his brother will ask him for help. “What is wrong?”</p>

      <p>“I seem to have been arrested...” Xichen says. “Could you come to the police station and pay my fine? I'm afraid I am unable to do it at the moment, and they may imprison me if I fail to do it now.”</p>

      <p>This is unexpected. There are many questions running through his head.</p>

      <p>“I see...” Wangji slowly says. “I will be there shortly.”</p>

      <p>He ends the call, still confused. He knows Xichen would have flown to Gusu today, but surely if he had been caught then he would have received far more than a fine.</p>

      <p>“What's up?” Wei Ying asks.</p>

      <p>Wangji places his phone back into his pocket. “I will need to go somewhere before we leave for your apartment.”</p>

      <p>“Sure, where?” The teacher takes another gulp of his coffee.</p>

      <p>“The police station. I must get my brother out of jail.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying chokes, slamming the mug down. He covers his mouth and coughs so loud that everyone in the café stares at them.</p>

      <p>“Right,” he says, still coughing slightly. He pounds on his chest a few times before he calms down. “I'm... I'm not even going to ask. Fair enough. Let's... get your brother out of jail then.”</p>

      <p>They leave the warmth of the café and make no haste for Wangji's car. Amazingly, Wei Ying does not ask any questions as they drive for the police station. He lays his head against the window and stares at the streets dashing past. His presence would be more appreciated if Wangji is not currently worried for Xichen.</p>

      <p>The police station is not very far, thankfully. Wei Ying follows him as he enters the building, his body tense. Wangji half expects an ambush of officers who may have found out he and his brother are immortal.</p>

      <p>What he does not expect is to hear Wei Ying groan behind him.</p>

      <p>He sees his brother, but there is also someone else there. They turn around and Wangji notices Wei Ying has edged closer to his side.</p>

      <p><em>“You!”</em> The person beside Xichen hisses.</p>

      <p>A familiar voice. As Wangji nears them, he realises it is also a familiar face, with shorter hair and an officer's uniform. The hatred in his eyes is exactly the same as it always has been.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng...” Wei Ying mumbles. He shuffles closer to Wangji again, his gaze flickering everywhere but at the man currently scowling in his direction.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Xichen gives Wangji a suffering smile. “Hello, Wangji. Thank you for coming...”</p>

      <p>Wangji nods. “Brother.”</p>

      <p>Then, a larger man walks past them. He stops. His head snaps from one person to the other, and the frown on his face gets deeper, and deeper.</p>

      <p>Oh. Wangji blinks. This face is familiar too. Nie Mingjue, if he is not mistaken. It has been a while since he has seen an incarnation of him.</p>

      <p>“What the hell is this?” Nie Mingjue demands. “A family gathering at my station? Get the fuck out of here!”</p>

      <p>He is still as quick tempered as before then. They watch as the large man stomps off. His angered steps are followed by the sound of a door slamming shut. Every officer nearby physically winces.</p>

      <p>Wangji pays for the fine with little care. The large number means little to him. Living for over two thousand years is helpful in that you can accumulate a tremendous sum of money over that time. He cannot help but notice that Xichen's sword is in Jiang Cheng's hand. Did his brother really get caught?</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Jiang Cheng's attention is on something else. Or someone else.</p>

      <p>“I told you not to show your face around here ever again,” he says. Wangji does not have to look behind him to know who he is talking to.</p>

      <p>“I'm leaving, I'm leaving,” Wei Ying sighs. He spins around and walks off without another word.</p>

      <p>Wangji has to stop himself from following him. This is none of his business but the sight of Wei Ying leaving is making him tense.</p>

      <p>“May we leave then?” Xichen asks, reading the mood, as usual.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looks like he wants to say no. However, with the fine paid and Xichen's sword still in his possession, the officer gives a stiff nod.</p>

      <p>Even his brother's gait is faster than normal as they exit the station. Wangji is glad to see Wei Ying waiting by his car, tapping his feet on the pavement. He practically dives into the passenger seat when Wangji unlocks the doors, apparently eager to get home. Or away from this police station, Wangji is not sure.</p>

      <p>The journey to Wei Ying's apartment is thick with silence. Xichen is in the back seat, staring between both of them.</p>

      <p>“Are you Wangji's friend?” he eventually asks. Wangji can't help but flinch at the use of 'friend'. Of course, Xichen already knows the answer to this.</p>

      <p>“Oh, I'm Sizhui's teacher,” Wei Ying says. He sits up to stare at Xichen through the front mirror. “Wei Ying.”</p>

      <p>Xichen's voice has a smile in it. “It is nice to meet you, although I wish it was under better circumstances. I am Lan Xichen.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying lets out a laugh. “No, you've made an impression.”</p>

      <p>His smile goes away and he stares out into the window again. Wangji takes his eyes off the road for a brief second to see if he is okay.</p>

      <p>“Sorry about Jiang Cheng though,” Wei Ying says. “He can be difficult when he's pissed off, which is a lot nowadays.”</p>

      <p>Xichen shakes his head. “There is no need for you to apologise.”</p>

      <p>They say nothing more after that. The drive to Wei Ying's apartment is too short and Wangji hates how he has to say goodbye to him now. It is approaching midday; Wangji wonders what Wei Ying will do for the rest of the weekend. He has still not finished asking every question he wants to know about him in this lifetime. One day is not enough at all.</p>

      <p>“Thanks again for the lift, Mr. Lan,” Wei Ying says when Wangji has handed his plastic bags to him again. “It was nice seeing you.”</p>

      <p>“You are welcome,” Wangji says. He nods at the bags Wei Ying is still struggling to carry. “Would you like me to carry them to your—”</p>

      <p>“No, I can manage. You've done enough.”</p>

      <p>All Wangji can do is watch as Wei Ying disappears back into his apartment, dragging the bags with him. From this distance, he can allow himself to smile as the teacher struggles to open the door. After almost a full minute, he succeeds in entering the building and he is gone.</p>

      <p>When he returns inside the car, Xichen lets out a big sigh. “I am glad to see you looking happy after all this time, Wangji. I truly am sorry I interrupted your time with him.”</p>

      <p>Wangji quickly shakes his head. Even if his time with Wei Ying was cut short, he can never blame his brother.</p>

      <p>“No need to apologise,” he says. “But are you... okay?”</p>

      <p>Nie Mingjue was in that police station. Xichen has been nothing but polite smiles ever since he has been in this car with Wei Ying. Wangji knows that is not all there is. Now, as he looks at the front mirror, all he sees is Xichen laying his head against the window, eyes closed.</p>

      <p>“I will be fine,” he says. “I am tired though.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm.”</p>

      <p>“Let's go home, Wangji. Today has been too long.”</p>

      <p>Wangji nods. He starts the car again, making his way back home. His brother said that today was too long, but he cannot agree with that. Not today. Everyday, for the past two thousand years or so, has felt long—but not this one. With Wei Ying, time flew by too fast. It feels like an illusion, looking back at it now.</p>

      <p>He cannot say he is happy, because he has forgotten what happiness is supposed to be, but perhaps he can say he is content. For now. For today. Tomorrow will be a new day, and the day after that, and the day after that. Wangji does not know what to do now that his future no longer looks empty. Wei Ying is here and he has thrown the monotonous schedule of Wangji's endless life into chaos.</p>

      <p>He does not mind it, he thinks. For once in his life, Wangji looks forward to tomorrow.</p>
