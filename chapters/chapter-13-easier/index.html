      <p>Their flight to Ohio is early; something which Wei Ying has clearly not prepared for. Wangji takes in his crumpled clothes, the drowsy scowl on his face, and the fact his hair is sticking up in several directions all at once. Compared to some flights Wangji has had over the years, eight AM is not too bothersome, but Wei Ying's eyelids are drooping and he is yawning non-stop. It should not be a surprise to see, that even in this life, Wei Ying is still not a morning person.</p>

      <p>Once they enter the private jet, the scowl on Wei Ying's face drops. His eyes boggle at their surroundings, standing frozen on the same spot for several minutes that Wangji begins to think he is in shock.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSo typical of the Jins to own something like this,‚Äù Wei Ying mutters. He then runs off to explore the jet, leaving Wangji by the entrance.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji watches him go, sighing when Wei Ying almost runs into a lampshade. Alone, Wangji allows himself to take in the cabin he is in. It is something you would expect from the Jin family; overly extravagant and gaudy. The interior itself is lavished in gold and white, reminding him of the Lanling Jin Sect's robes many, many years ago. Hanging from the ceiling is a gleaming chandelier; Wangji would not be surprised if it was made out of real diamonds and gold, considering how much the Jins like to show off. There is a white sofa running along one side of the jet and a large plasma TV on the opposite wall, playing a movie of some sort. Thankfully, it is not Shrek.</p>
      
      <p>In one corner is a bar with an array of wine bottles behind its counter; a lady wearing a golden dress is already there, waiting to serve. She bows to Wangji, smiling when he passes her. As he walks further, he spots a table large enough for two, overlooking a wide window clearly designed for a romantic ambience once they set off flying. He frowns at the vase of roses on the table, stroking the petals before entering the next cabin.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji almost fails to see Wei Ying. He hears a faint chuckle, spotting him nestled in the large bed at the centre of the room. Once he has been seen, he pops out of the blankets.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI know the Jins are rich but this is ridiculous,‚Äù Wei Ying says, although it looks like he is enjoying the bed. ‚ÄúLan Zhan, have you ever been on a private jet like this?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji shakes his head. With the money he and Xichen have, they could buy a private jet of their own but doing so will only attract unneeded attention.</p>
      
      <p>Yawning, Wei Ying stretches on the bed. He has taken off his coat now, and as usual he wears a black turtle-neck jumper with those jeans that Wangji deems are far too tight. Over the months he has seen him, Wangji has noticed Wei Ying likes to wear jumpers, mostly baggy; pairing them with the most form-fitting jeans he has ever seen in his long life. It is both a blessing and a curse. Wei Ying looks wonderful, as he always does, but watching him lay around in bed with that outfit is almost too much for Wangji. It is even worse when Wei Ying rolls to one side, causing the jumper to ride up and expose his stomach for a brief second.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji looks away, forcing himself to study the details of a nearby painting.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm tired, Lan Zhan,‚Äù Wei Ying whines. ‚ÄúThis bed is so comfy...‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Refusing to look at him, Wangji turns back to the main cabin. ‚ÄúWe will depart soon. You should sit down.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He leaves, hearing the sound of Wei Ying's footsteps shortly following him.</p>
      
      <p>Both of them sit down, waiting for the jet to depart. Wei Ying is beside him, already laying his head on Wangji's shoulder as he had done yesterday. It is still taking Wangji a while to get used to all of this; even before Wei Ying died, he was more prone to pushing Wangji away rather than welcoming him. His time as the Yiling Patriarch only caused a rift between them that grew as the years passed. Wangji will never forget that Wei Ying's last words to him were to tell him to get lost. How ironic that was one of the first phrases Wangji himself said to Wei Ying.</p>
      
      <p>He had taken for granted Wei Ying's affection before. He will not do that again.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji wraps an arm around Wei Ying's waist, his heart hammering under his ribs the moment Wei Ying leans closer. They remain like that, even as the jet is taking off; Wei Ying's eyes are closed, one hand resting on Wangji's chest. The view of the country underneath them is lovely in this weather, though Wangji keeps his eyes on Wei Ying the whole time.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHave you ever been to America, Lan Zhan?‚Äù Wei Ying asks out of nowhere.</p>
      
      <p>It takes Wangji a while to revisit all of the countries he has travelled to. He has definitely been to America before. It is remembering <em>when</em> that is the problem.</p>
      
      <p>He nods.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOh really? When?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA while ago. Too long.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying cranes his head to look up at him. ‚ÄúDid you like it? Where did you go?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The last time he was in America... It cannot have been in these past two centuries. He did not stay there for too long; roughly only twenty years as far as he can remember. Because they had to be careful to avoid drawing attention to themselves, Wangji and Xichen spent a lot of their lives isolated and in hiding, limiting their interactions with everyone and disclosing as little information about themselves as possible. It was an empty existence, one that was necessary to survive‚Äîeven if both of them did not care for their lives.</p>
      
      <p>Even so, there is one memory in America that stands out to Wangji.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIt was nothing special,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI remember... a circus in California.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>It was some time after the Industrial Revolution, around 1880. Men wore fitted tailcoats and ruffled muslin shirts, styling their hair with wax and adorning them with hats. Wangji only remembers because he hated how tight the clothes felt on him. It was his first time travelling to the West, and the differences he found in America made him want to return home. Xichen also did not accompany him, choosing to travel by himself instead.</p>
      
      <p>Alone and already despising the new environment, Wangji focused on the same goal he had been chasing for endless years: finding Wei Ying. If Wei Ying was nowhere to be found back home, then perhaps he would be hiding at the opposite side of the world.</p>
      
      <p>His search led him to many odd places: bustling town centres where the air was thick with smog; dark alleyways roaming with prostitutes and thieves whose eyes never left him; the wilderness of a forest where he thought he heard the faint sound of a flute, only to find it was nothing but his tired imagination. Despite everything, the oddest place was a circus he stumbled upon in the middle of the night.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying would have enjoyed the bright lights and loud music, the dozens of people dressed in extravagant costumes. Considering his phobia of dogs, Wangji wondered if he would have been scared of the tigers and lions too; even he was surprised to see them being used for performances at first. He had never witnessed such pure chaos. In the circus, there were no rules; only the goal to entertain and to shock.</p>
      
      <p>But he did not come to the circus to enjoy the shows. At first, he came for the simple reason of finding Wei Ying. As expected, he was not there among the cheering crowds, or even the performers. While the circus was packed with lively faces, Wangji knew he would have spotted Wei Ying from a mile away. He would have known.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji stayed for the fortune teller. He had heard the crowds talking about a beautiful woman who spoke of unknown, impossible things, revealing information about themselves they never dared to tell anyone. Wangji did not believe it; circuses were famous for fooling their audiences‚Äîbut that did not mean he was not desperate.</p>
      
      <p>And so, he sought out this mysterious fortune teller.</p>
      
      <p>To say he was surprised was an understatement. The mysterious fortune teller was no fake; she was an immortal, just like him. She greeted him with a smile, as if they had known each other all their lives.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHanguang-Jun, I was beginning to wonder if you were going to visit or not,‚Äù she said.</p>
      
      <p>Her irises were like a void; completely black and endless. The more Wangji stared at her, the more he felt time disintegrating around them. She had hair as black as her eyes, falling in inky waves down to her waist; and her skin was a pale and sharp contrast, as colourless as the full moon during that evening.</p>
      
      <p>He had never seen her before. She was dressed entirely in white; if Wangji did not sense the spiritual energy illuminating in this tent, he would have mistaken her for a ghost.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he asked.</p>
      
      <p>Her lips spread into a smile. ‚ÄúDon't you want to ask something else?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>She was an immortal much older than him. Much, <em>much</em> older. Wangji wondered why she bothered to stay here with the humans. Surely, with her power, she could ascend to the heavens?</p>
      
      <p>The smile she had on her face did little to reassure Wangji. He did not want to show weakness in asking her the question that threatened to scream out, <em>begging</em> for an answer.</p>
      
      <p>But he was weak, and Wei Ying mattered more than his pride.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhere is he? Where is Wei Wuxian?‚Äù he asked. <em>Will I ever see him again?</em></p>
      
      <p>The immortal's eyes softened and she gave a soft sigh. Wangji was reminded of his own mother; it was the same look she gave him whenever he asked if they could visit her again.</p>
      
      <p>As he grew up, he learnt not to ask impossible questions. Wei Ying was different. Wangji refused to make him impossible.</p>
      
      <p>Rather than answering his question, the immortal answered his thoughts.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou want to see him again,‚Äù she said, her voice dancing around the tent. ‚ÄúThat will depend on whether he wants to be found.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji did not understand what that meant‚Äîor rather, he did; he just did not <em>want</em> to. If Wei Ying's soul refused to return, then what else could he do? Why was he still waiting for him?</p>
      
      <p>For many years, he asked himself that question; and yet, for all those years, he still waited for Wei Ying. There was nothing else left for him but to wait.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Wei Ying says, ‚Äúyou met a fortune teller at a circus... Did you ask them anything, Lan Zhan?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji returns his gaze to Wei Ying. That night at the circus was two centuries ago, back when he dreaded he would never see Wei Ying again. Now, as Wei Ying clings to his arm and fills this jet with the scent of lotus blooms, Wangji is glad he never gave up.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOne question,‚Äù he replies.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhat was it? Don't people usually ask about their true love or something? Did she tell you you'll meet them in the distant future?‚Äù Wei Ying laughs.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúClose.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The laughter dies, replaced by a small pout. Wei Ying shakes his arm.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAre you not going to tell me? That's mean, Lan Zhan.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji expects Wei Ying to throw a barrage of questions his way. He has never been one to give up, especially when he is trying to pester something out of someone. To his surprise, Wei Ying falls silent, the grip on Wangji's arm loosening.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHave you ever been in love?‚Äù he asks out of nowhere.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji's eyebrows furrow. He looks down, only to find Wei Ying's gaze is not on him. He is fiddling with the sleeve of his jumper, twisting and pulling it over his hand.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Wangji says without hesitation.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying blinks, a frown tugging at his eyebrows. ‚ÄúOh. Huh. Did it not work out?"</p>
      
      <p><em>You did not love me back. You would not accept my love. You died.</em></p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI have never told them,‚Äù Wangji says. The conversation makes him feel like he is treading on eggshells; one wrong word and Wei Ying will know everything.</p>
      
      <p>‚Äú<em>Oh</em>... That sucks.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhat... about you?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji holds his breath, despising himself for asking such a question. When Wei Ying shakes his head, he despises himself even more for feeling relief. Wei Ying deserves to be loved but Wangji's selfishness is a strong emotion that wins over him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNo. Not yet. Are... Are you still...‚Äù Wei Ying turns to Wangji; the frown on his face deepens before he lets out a sigh. ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHm?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head for the second time. ‚Äú<em>Anyway</em>, I'm tired.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The change in topic is strange. Wangji decides not to pursue it.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSleep,‚Äù he says.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúMaybe... Oh, wait. I want to use that fancy bed!‚Äù Wei Ying stands up all of a sudden, grabbing his hand.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji allows himself to get dragged to the next cabin. The implications of being led into a room with a bed is not entirely lost on him. For the sake of his own sanity, he ignores whatever his brain is trying to conjure and desperately recites the Cloud Recesses' four thousand and nineteen rules in his head.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying lets go of his hand, diving first into the bed. As he makes himself comfortable, Wangji takes a seat by the desk.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou know, Lan Zhan, I never thought that private jets could have beds in them. Wouldn't you fall off it once the plane lands?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSit down when the plane is landing,‚Äù Wangji says, watching the clouds outside.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSpeaking of which, why are you sitting there?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Sighing, Wangji turns to Wei Ying just in time as a pillow is thrown at him. It hits his shoulder and rolls onto the floor.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSit here, Lan Zhan,‚Äù Wei Ying says, patting the space next to him on the bed.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji slowly retrieves the pillow, running his hands over it in case it has picked up any dust from the floor. He has no intentions of denying Wei Ying, even if all of this affection being thrown at him is maddening.</p>
      
      <p>The bed dips as Wangji joins Wei Ying in the centre. Wei Ying does not hesitate in laying his head on his chest, no doubt hearing how fast Wangji's heart is pumping against his ribs. Fortunately, he makes no comment on it.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Wangji asks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm... nervous about seeing Jiejie, but I'm okay for now,‚Äù Wei Ying says. ‚ÄúIt helps you're here.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI am glad.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Silence falls between them. It is comfortable; not the sort of silence where Wangji feels he has to say something. Wei Ying hums, reaching for his hand. He traces a finger along Wangji's palm.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou have very nice hands, Lan Zhan. Has anybody ever told you that?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji breathes out. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, you have very pretty hands,‚Äù Wei Ying says, playing with his fingers.</p>
      
      <p>Curious, Wangji repeats the same to him. Wei Ying's skin is soft, his hands surprisingly smaller than Wangji's. He follows the lines on Wei Ying's palm, drawing over them with his finger.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying giggles. ‚ÄúThat tickles.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The sound alone is enough to make Wangji's heart swell. His eyes soften at the expression Wei Ying has on his face, the content smile spreading over his lips. It reaches his eyes now; nothing like the fake smiles he has been forcing for these past few months.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou have a nice smile,‚Äù Wangji tells him, unable to stop himself.</p>
      
      <p>In an instant, it disappears. Wei Ying bites his lip, avoiding his gaze. ‚ÄúOnly I'm allowed to tease you, Lan Zhan,‚Äù he mumbles.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNot teasing. It is the truth.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The blush spreads on Wei Ying's cheeks. He shakes his head, lightly swatting Wangji's chest.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou should smile more,‚Äù Wangji continues.</p>
      
      <p>His comment succeeds in getting Wei Ying to do so, although it is obvious he is trying his best not to. Why is he being so shy all of a sudden? Wangji is only saying the truth. There is no need to hide from such facts.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAh, Lan Zhan, where are all these compliments coming from?‚Äù Wei Ying asks. ‚ÄúYou're going to milk my ego at this rate. Do you think my smile is cute?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji nods. ‚ÄúNot just your smile.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>A choked noise comes out of Wei Ying. He looks like he is tempted to hit Wangji again.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI can't win against you,‚Äù Wei Ying says. ‚ÄúI admit defeat, Mr. Lan. I never thought you'd be such a smooth talker after all this time.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji says nothing, merely content with lying on this bed with Wei Ying in his arms. Wei Ying continues to play with his fingers and Wangji gathers the courage to stroke his hair, smoothing back the strands that curl in different directions. He hears a faint sigh coming from the teacher, inwardly smiling as Wei Ying leans much closer. Seeing that he seems to like it, Wangji does not stop.</p>
      
      <p>In time, Wei Ying's eyes close and his breaths turn even. Quiet, Wangji looks down at him, studying the slope of his nose; his thick eyelashes fluttering out; the parting of his lips. He is still. It does not take Wangji long to realise he has fallen asleep.</p>
      
      <p>Wei Ying must have been tired to fall asleep so suddenly. Gently, Wangji tucks his hair behind his ear, moving the strands away from his face. He is content staying like this for the next several hours, drowning in the scent of lotus flowers and mint.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng hates waiting. No matter how many years have passed, he can still remember the agony of waiting in that hospital corridor, only for the doctor to tell him his parents were dead. He remembers the second time, how he'd been too numb to let it all sink in that he could lose his sister too; how he'd wanted, more than anything, to tear Wei Ying apart once the doctor told him she was in a coma. Wei Ying ran away that day, and Jiang Cheng was left alone, to wait‚Äîas usual. He waited and waited; still, his sister is in hospital and Wei Ying will never fit into this family he'd torn apart.</p>
      
      <p>So, it's an understatement to say Jiang Cheng hates waiting. He hates not having control, leaving his life to chance where it could fall apart again. He hates not being able to do <em>anything.</em></p>
      
      <p>He and Jin Ling arrived in Ohio earlier this morning, and ever since then A-Jie has been fast asleep. Jiang Cheng knows she's only sleeping, but the waiting is giving him all sorts of anxiety. It's past eight PM here now; they've been sat by Yanli's bed for almost two hours with only the sounds of the machines around her to keep them company.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling has fallen asleep on his chair, still tired from their flight. As much as Jiang Cheng would like to rest as well, he can't. Not until he's managed to talk to his sister and made sure she's okay.</p>
      
      <p>She's breathing, which is always a good sign. That seems to be the <em>only</em> good thing he can see. Jiang Cheng can barely recognise his own sister; she's bone thin and her skin is sickly pale, nothing like the smiling bride she should have been on her wedding day. He clenches his fists, seeing something else other than this hospital. He sees the banquet before him, the blinding colours of red and gold. Most of all, he sees his sister falling down those marble stairs, surrounded by a puddle of her own blood.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan can tell him time and time again it was an accident. Jiang Cheng himself knows it was just an accident. But that doesn't stop the overwhelming anger that engulfs him whenever he remembers who exactly pushed his sister down those stairs.</p>
      
      <p>A soft murmur catches his attention. He quickly sits up, watching his sister's eyes flutter open.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Jie!‚Äù he calls.</p>
      
      <p>That wakes up Jin Ling. He jumps, looking around in panic. As soon as he sees his mother, the teenager lunges forward and clings to her arm. ‚ÄúMom!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Ling... A-Cheng?‚Äù Yanli's voice shakes as she looks between both of them.</p>
      
      <p>She reaches for Jin Ling, stroking back his bangs with shaking hands. Her eyes well up with tears, a weak laugh escaping her as Jin Ling starts to cry too. He tries to hide this fact by ducking his head down, furiously wiping his cheeks.</p>
      
      <p>Although she is pale and thin, the smile animates her whole face. All of the anxiety leaves Jiang Cheng for now; he's just happy his sister is here.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Ling, you've grown so much,‚Äù she says, wiping his tears for him. ‚ÄúYou're starting to look like your dad.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng smirks, folding his arms. ‚ÄúIs that a compliment?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Yanli lets out another laugh, turning to him. ‚ÄúAnd you, A-Cheng. You've become so handsome.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>It's impossible to stop the blush that creeps up on his cheeks. Jiang Cheng is quick to glance away, pretending to be unfazed by her compliment.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù he asks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúTired, but I'm better now that you two are here.‚Äù Yanli looks around them, searching the room. ‚ÄúWhere is...?</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDad's taking a nap right now. He was up all night yesterday,‚Äù Jin Ling tells her.</p>
      
      <p>She sighs. ‚ÄúI keep telling him to sleep but he never does.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>With the way Jin Zixuan is constantly travelling back and forth both countries, Jiang Cheng wonders how he even deals with jetlag. Does the man ever sleep? Whenever he calls them back at home, Jiang Cheng swears it's always dead in the night wherever Jin Zixuan is supposed to be.</p>
      
      <p>He may find the man annoying, but there's no denying how dedicated he is to his wife.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIs A-Ying coming?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng and Jin Ling exchange glances at her question. Just the mention of his name and there's already tension in the air; anger automatically coursing inside Jiang Cheng. Jin Ling purses his lips, awkwardly looking down at his hands. If it's already like this now, how can they bear to have Wei Ying in the same room? Jin Zixuan should have never invited him here.</p>
      
      <p>Yanli sighs.</p>
      
      <p>Swallowing the lump in his throat, Jiang Cheng forces himself to speak. ‚ÄúI... I think so. Your husband called him yesterday and offered him a flight here.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>It's hard to ignore how much it hurts to see her smiling at this.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng stiffly nods. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He wishes he can change the subject. In the space of a few seconds, his sister's face is filled with life again. The sickly tone of her skin is nothing compared to how wide her smile is, how excited she is to see the same man Jiang Cheng wishes will leave their lives for good.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIt's been too long since all three of us have been together,‚Äù Yanli says.</p>
      
      <p>‚Äú...Yeah.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The three of them together. She says it's like they can still live like they used to before all this happened. Does A-Jie expect him to shake hands with Wei Ying? Hug him? Call him his brother again? Even just thinking about it is making Jiang Cheng want to laugh. There's no way he and Wei Ying can go back to that. At the very least, he'll keep things civil between them‚Äîfor A-Jie‚Äîbut he doesn't want anything else. There's nothing more they can say to each other.</p>
      
      <p>He doesn't have the heart to tell this to his sister, of course. Jiang Cheng keeps his thoughts to himself, letting it fill his chest with needles.</p>
      
      <p>It's only when Yanli suddenly starts to cough that Jiang Cheng forgets about these feelings‚Äîfor now.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúMom!‚Äù Jin Ling cries, panicking at the sight of her struggling to breathe.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng stands, rubbing her back and waiting for her coughs to subside. When she's done, he passes her the glass of water on her bedside table.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI-I'm fine,‚Äù she reassures, patting Jin Ling's head. ‚ÄúDon't worry.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Jie, you should rest more,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI want to talk to both of you... A-Ling, I can't believe how much you've grown.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling grins, sitting up straighter. ‚ÄúI'm taller than Uncle Meng Yao now!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng snorts. ‚ÄúEveryone's taller than him.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah but Dad says I'm even taller than <em>you</em> when you were this age!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHe's a fucking liar!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The room is filled with the sound of Yanli's laughter. Jiang Cheng clings onto it, having missed his sister for too, too long.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Ying was taller than you,‚Äù she says.</p>
      
      <p>Hearing <em>his</em> name almost ruins the mood. Jiang Cheng desperately ignores the bitterness that instantly claws at him; he won't let Wei Ying ruin this moment.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúBy <em>one</em> centimetre. I'm taller than him now though.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Yanli raises her eyebrows. ‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, he's fucking tiny.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>That gets her to laugh again. Even if Jiang Cheng doesn't approve of the topic of their conversation, he's glad she's happy.</p>
      
      <p>Behind them, the door opens.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhat are you two doing, not giving her any rest?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng turns around and sees Jin Zixuan walking over to them. He looks more rested than he did earlier. When they met with him, he had dark bags under his eyes and Jiang Cheng was convinced he'd fall asleep standing up. It took Jin Ling almost half an hour to convince his dad to actually take a nap, reassuring him they'll call as soon as possible if anything happened.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDad! I thought you were sleeping?‚Äù Jin Ling says, groaning when Zixuan ruffles his hair. He tries to push him off, though the smile creeping up on his face tells Jiang Cheng he doesn't mind the attention at all.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúJust woke up. A-Li, how long have you been awake?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNot too long.‚Äù Yanli reaches up to stroke his cheek, frowning slightly. ‚ÄúYou look tired. Sleep properly, okay?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Zixuan shakes his head. His eyes squint with a glow that is neither arrogant or playful; just doting. ‚ÄúI should be worrying about <em>you</em>. Anyway, what were you laughing about?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Cheng was telling me how short A-Ying is now.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Eyebrows raised, Zixuan turns his attention to Jiang Cheng. After all the difficulty he had in trying to get Jiang Cheng to invite Wei Ying here, he knows more than anyone that reconciliation between the brothers is impossible. Jiang Cheng ignores his confused glance, pretending to be interested in his phone instead.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHmm. Yeah, now that you mention it, he is,‚Äù Zixuan says after a while, averting his gaze back to his wife. ‚ÄúHe just texted me to say he's on the jet now. He should land in fourteen hours.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>Fourteen hours.</em></p>
      
      <p>Tomorrow, he'll be here.</p>
      
      <p>What would they do?</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng scans the room. Jin Ling is staring at his parents with large eyes, as if trying to commit this to memory. Zixuan is now holding Yanli's hand, fussing over her and asking a dozen questions about how she's feeling. No matter how many times she tells him she's okay now, he's still worrying. Jiang Cheng has half a mind to tell him to shut up.</p>
      
      <p>Would Wei Ying be here among them tomorrow? He grits his teeth, unable to imagine having him in the same room. How could they pretend everything is okay, after all that's happened between them?</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng stands.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Cheng?‚Äù A-Jie calls, her voice raising with concern.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm tired,‚Äù he quickly says. ‚ÄúI think I'll go take a nap as well.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>His sister smiles when he says goodbye for now. He knows there's no fooling her. She's always been able to read what's on his mind. He leaves, already suffocating in that room when Wei Ying's presence is only the mention of his name. There's no way Jiang Cheng will be able to take whatever tomorrow throws at him.</p>
      
      <p>It's dark out. He wraps his coat tighter around himself, gazing up at the sky. Here in the city, the lights are too bright to see any of the stars; above him is nothing but a black void staring back. They're staying over at Zixuan's penthouse for the week, which is luckily at walking distance from the hospital. Nonetheless, Jiang Cheng takes his time walking through the city. It's only eight PM but the night is already bustling with life; flooded with couples and families who want to go out for dinner, groups of friends beginning their drunken parties.</p>
      
      <p>Looking at them, Jiang Cheng can't help but feel old. It really has been too long.</p>
      
      <p>Sighing, he makes his way back to their hotel, alone.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Xichen regrets taking a day off. He thought the time alone would benefit him in some way, perhaps help him sort through his mind. So far today, he has done nothing but stare into space, too distracted to do anything productive, too troubled to pass the time meditating. It is a blessing that Wangji has decided to go to Ohio with Wei Wuxian, leaving Sizhui in his care. At least then he will not have to be alone with his thoughts later tonight.</p>
      
      <p>For now, the only way to pass the time is to distract himself. He enters the caf√© his brother once mentioned, immediately recognising the Ghost General working at the counter‚Äîwell, of course, he is no longer known under that title.</p>
      
      <p>As he waits for his drink to be served, Xichen leans against the counter and admires the interior of the place. It is a cosy little caf√©; there are plants hanging from the ceiling and the walls, befitting of its name <em>The Hidden Forest</em>. At the moment, it is fairly empty with everyone either being in school or at work. He can only see a lone university student typing away at their laptop in one corner, and two men huddled by the window‚Äî</p>
      
      <p>Xichen freezes. His eyes must be deceiving him.</p>
      
      <p>Those men... Are they...?</p>
      
      <p><em>No.</em></p>
      
      <p>He is thrown back to the treasured times he's locked away deep inside. A flash, and he sees himself in that same table, laughing at something either of them had said. They drink together; tea for him, and wine for the two, wondering what the future has in store for the three of them. It is a rare memory stashed in between the time of war and the time where his two dearest friends began to fight with each other; a memory untouched by troubles, when Xichen thought this peace would last forever.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúLan Xichen? Sir? That is you... r-right? I have your coffee.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen blinks, turning back to Wen Ning. He forces a smile on his face, taking his drink.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he says.</p>
      
      <p>He needs to leave. Now. Everything burns at the thought of being in the same room as <em>them</em>, and the flames engulf him more when he sees a head turning towards his way. Xichen grips the drink tighter, preparing to go.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSir! Mister!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He stops. The blood in his veins turn cold.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou, yes, you, handsome Sir! Why don't you sit next to us?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen's body moves by itself. He faces them now, unable to breathe, willing the ground to collapse under his feet. He has already seen Mingjue-xiong at the police station when he returned to Gusu but the sight of him continues to suffocate Xichen. Today, he is not in his police uniform, dressed instead in a casual T-shirt and jeans. He stares at Xichen with a raised eyebrow, then turns to the other man sat in front of him.</p>
      
      <p><em>A-Yao.</em></p>
      
      <p>No. Jin Guangyao.</p>
      
      <p>He is smiling at Xichen, transporting him back to the time when his life crumbled into ashes, when the Cloud Recesses was destroyed and his father fatally injured. He had ran away to preserve what little he could of their sect's books and scrolls, hating himself with every step he took. After days and days of running, he finally collapsed.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Guangyao found him. He was called Meng Yao at the time; still so young and innocent, with dreams of joining the cultivator world. Without any other source of comfort or help at that time, Xichen quickly trusted Meng Yao. He helped him when Xichen was on the run, comforted him when no one else could. Xichen preserved the memory of that young man in his mind, choosing to let Meng Yao blind him from the true colours of Jin Guangyao.</p>
      
      <p>It is difficult to see who is in front of him now.</p>
      
      <p>His hair is shorter, although not cropped short like Nie Mingjue's; Jin Guangyao's is long enough that it trails down to his shoulder, tucked behind his ear on one side. He wears a black beret on his head, and an oversized cardigan over his shirt. If Xichen did not know him, he would have mistaken him for any friendly looking stranger.</p>
      
      <p>But he does know him, and it hurts.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWait, I know you,‚Äù Nie Mingjue says.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Guangyao's eyes widen at him. ‚ÄúYou do?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúJiang Cheng arrested him a while ago.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>‚ÄúArrested?‚Äù</em></p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, what'd he arrest you for again?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen does not expect to be included into this conversation. He fumbles for something to say, but comes up with nothing.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù Nie Mingjue says, suddenly remembering. ‚ÄúHe was in possession of dangerous weapons in public. A sword.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA <em>sword?</em> My, my, that is... something.‚Äù Jin Guangyao releases a chuckle, gazing up at Xichen. ‚ÄúDon't just stand there. Would you like to sit with us?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue scoffs. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDa-ge, don't be rude. I thought he looked a bit lonely so I'm inviting him to talk with us. Besides, your company leaves a lot to be desired.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>Da-ge.</em></p>
      
      <p>This is bringing back too many memories all at once. Xichen cannot find the strength to move.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI told you to stop calling me that!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>Just go</em>, Xichen tells himself as he listens to the two. Neither of them know who he is here. If he says he is busy, they will easily brush him off and the three of them can return to their separate lives. He will do everything in his power to stay away from them, to make sure history is not repeated.</p>
      
      <p><em>Just go.</em></p>
      
      <p>However, as he looks between the two, he cannot ignore the feeling of relief in his heart. They seem well. Happy. If they are sat here together, that must mean they are no longer fighting.</p>
      
      <p>He misses them.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen does not know what possesses him; he grabs the seat between the two and sits down.</p>
      
      <p>Jin Guangyao's smile grows. ‚ÄúMy name is Meng Yao, and... well, I suppose you already know Chief Nie Mingjue.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>Meng Yao</em>... So he is calling himself Meng Yao. Xichen is not sure what to feel about that.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI... I am Lan Xichen.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDo you go here often?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNo, it is my first time here in this caf√©.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Guangyao‚Äî<em>Meng Yao</em> slowly nods, raising his drink to his lips. ‚ÄúThis is my favourite caf√© in Gusu.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen looks around the small caf√©. More people have entered it now but it is still fairly quiet. Nevertheless, he remembers the first time he saw Meng Yao here in Gusu. It was a TV interview, was it not? If he is famous, then why is he here?</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI thought... Am I right in saying that you are an actor?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao's eyes widen, laying his cup down on the table.</p>
      
      <p>Beside them, Nie Mingjue smirks. ‚ÄúStop pretending to be so humble about it.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI am, Chief Nie. I'm not used to being recognised yet,‚Äù Meng Yao defends himself. ‚ÄúBut yes, Mr. Lan, I am a fairly new actor; Jin Guangyao is my stage name. This caf√© mainly attracts the older generation though, so not many tend to recognise me here.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>Oh.</em> He uses Jin Guangyao as his stage name? It is... strangely fitting.</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao tilts his head at Xichen. ‚ÄúHave you watched me acting?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen shakes his head. ‚ÄúNo, I saw one of your interviews a few weeks ago.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAh, I see.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue is quietly eating his rice wine soup, occasionally looking up to roll his eyes at something Meng Yao says. Catching one of his glances, Meng Yao frowns, pointing his chopsticks at him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúChief Nie, A-Sang told me you started watching Crimson Heart. What do you think of it?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA waste of my time.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Old habits die hard; as soon as Xichen thinks they are beginning to squabble, he opens his mouth to try and mediate the situation. <em>Calm down, you two. Stop fighting.</em></p>
      
      <p>He presses his lips together, swallowing down the words.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúThat's not very nice,‚Äù Meng Yao says. ‚ÄúI don't think A-Sang will be happy to hear that.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚Äú<em>Tch.</em> His parts were fine.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAnd what about mine?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI didn't care for them.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao exchanges looks with Xichen. He acts out a dramatic sigh, reaching for his drink again. Xichen spots the amusement in his amber eyes.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAre you two... friends?‚Äù Xichen asks, unable to hide his curiosity.</p>
      
      <p>Mingjue-xiong is not actively trying to kill Meng Yao, therefore that is already an improvement from last time; nevertheless, it still does not look like they are on the best of terms.</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue snorts.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúUs?‚Äù Meng Yao shrugs. ‚Äú<em>I</em> would presume we are, but Chief Nie seems to think otherwise.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHow do you two know each other?‚Äù he asks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúJiang Cheng is his brother-in-law; we met through him,‚Äù Nie Mingjue tells Xichen. ‚ÄúMeng Yao hasn't stopped bothering me ever since.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao leans into Xichen, feigning a whisper. ‚ÄúChief Nie doesn't approve of my... celebrity status.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue's dark eyes narrow at them. ‚ÄúNot when you're always getting into shitty scandals.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIt was one or two, Chief Nie. Everyone does silly things when they're drunk. I must say though; your brother is quite the party animal. If you are unhappy with me, perhaps you should pay more attention to <em>him</em>.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHe gets it from you, I'm sure.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúLet's not argue in front of our new friend,‚Äù Meng Yao says, nodding towards Xichen. He offers Xichen another smile; a sharp contrast to the exasperated look he was directing towards Nie Mingjue a second ago.</p>
      
      <p>Another scoffs comes out of the older man. Nie Mingjue sits back on his chair, folding his arms. His gaze lands on Xichen as well.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDid Jiang Cheng ever interrogate you about the missing sword?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOh... Yes, he did.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao frowns. ‚ÄúMissing sword?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue nods at him. ‚ÄúWe confiscated the sword he was caught with, but it went missing after a few days. Jiang Cheng was convinced he stole it back.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>A smile tugs up on Xichen's face as he remembers Jiang Cheng's insistence on the matter. However, the fond memory is quickly dashed away. Their last encounter had not been so good; Xichen regrets his thoughtless actions, but he should be used to unknowingly hurting people by now. It seems he has a talent for it.</p>
      
      <p>He looks down, taking a sip of his coffee. ‚ÄúI've told him time and time again that I did not steal it. I even allowed him to search my home.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue quickly shakes his head. ‚ÄúDon't let him search your home. He'll rip it apart.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>A forlorn laugh escapes Xichen. ‚ÄúI... am aware of that.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Come to think of it, Jiang Cheng should be in America by now. Xichen hopes his sister is well.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúMr. Lan, what do you do for a living? I've never seen you around before,‚Äù Meng Yao says.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen faces him. His curious eyes really are far too much like the old Meng Yao, the one who used to offer to do his laundry for him because he knew Xichen would just rip his clothes apart instead. It is funny how, even after all these centuries, Xichen is still clinging onto these na√Øve memories.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI am a librarian,‚Äù he says, urgently trying to hang onto the present. ‚ÄúI've only just moved back to Gusu a couple of months ago.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue stretches his arms, clicking a few bones and causing Meng Yao to wince at him. ‚ÄúWhere did you live before?‚Äù he asks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúLondon.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúLondon!‚Äù Meng Yao exclaims. ‚ÄúChief Nie, that was going to be my suggestion for your holiday. Go to London! I heard it's very nice.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue's lip curls. ‚ÄúI don't give a shit about cities. I'd be fine just finding somewhere to go camping.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>It is currently winter. While the cold does not affect Xichen, the thought of camping in this season sends a shiver up his spine.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúCamping does not sound pleasant in this weather,‚Äù he says.</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue shakes his head. ‚ÄúNot now. Can't afford a holiday now. There's too much mess going around Gusu.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù Meng Yao murmurs, ‚Äúare there no leads on the gang attacks yet?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The conversation stops. Nie Mingjue averts his eyes to Xichen, eyebrows twitching.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm sure Mr. Lan can be trusted,‚Äù Meng Yao assures him.</p>
      
      <p>The chief police officer sighs. ‚ÄúI'm not sure I even trust <em>you.</em> But no, there's no new leads yet. It's been quiet since the last attack.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen cannot ignore that. ‚ÄúWhat attacks?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao looks around them, leaning closer again and speaking in a quiet voice. ‚ÄúFor the past year or so, there have been random attacks happening around Gusu. Chief Nie reckons a gang is responsible for them.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúEnough of that,‚Äù Nie Mingjue snaps. ‚ÄúThis is confidential information. Don't just go telling it to a random guy.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Raising his eyebrows, Meng Yao leans back. He beams at Xichen and says nothing more, returning to his food. Nie Mingjue grumbles something under his breath, asking himself why he bothers to tell Meng Yao anything. The two of them exchange quips; it is harmless, and Xichen would have been tempted to laugh in another life, but he cannot ignore the looming thought that he should not be here in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>For some odd reason, Meng Yao has been trying to add him into their conversation. He is friendly‚Äîperhaps a bit too friendly. Xichen gathers it is because he is content in this life; if he is a successful actor, then it must mean the public is not scorning him like they had done so back when they were cultivators. He has everything he could want here, as should Nie Mingjue.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen wants to be happy for them. He has always hoped to see his sworn brothers at peace with one another, enjoying a life they deserved. Now, as he is faced with the very thing, all he feels is loneliness.</p>
      
      <p>He does not belong here. He should not be here.</p>
      
      <p>Gripping the table, he stands up. ‚ÄúI... I ought to go.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSo soon?‚Äù Meng Yao says.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI must pick my nephew up from school.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI see...‚Äù Meng Yao nods. ‚ÄúThank you for speaking with us, Mr. Lan. It was nice to meet you.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúThe pleasure was mine. Thank you... Actor Jin, Chief Nie.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Nie Mingjue grunts a reply, half-heartedly waving in his direction.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAh, please, just call me Meng Yao,‚Äù the actor tells Xichen.</p>
      
      <p>‚Äú...Meng Yao, then.‚Äù Saying his name out loud felt so strange. It has been too, too long since that name has been used. ‚ÄúLikewise, please call me Xichen.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao grins. ‚ÄúHow about Er-ge?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen almost drops his drink.</p>
      
      <p><em>‚ÄúEr-ge, whatever I've said is the truth.‚Äù</em></p>
      
      <p><em>‚ÄúI have already told you that you do not need to call me Er-ge anymore.‚Äù</em></p>
      
      <p>His throat dries. In his place, Xichen does not see Meng Yao. He sees Jin Guangyao, still smiling, trying to explain the reasons for his crimes.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhat are you going on about now?‚Äù Nie Mingjue snaps, glaring at them.</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao laughs. ‚Äú<em>Da-ge</em>; since it's the three of us, haha.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Too much. It is all too much. Meng Yao's laughter dances around him, reminding him of happier times. He wants to grasp onto them and convince himself everything is okay, everything will be easier now that he can get the closure he needs. After all, is this not what he has always been hoping for? Can he not move on? <em>Why</em> must he hold onto his mistakes?</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm just kidding. Don't mind me, Xichen-ge,‚Äù Meng Yao says.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen forces a smile at both of them. It is all he can muster with all of these memories rushing in his head. He bids farewell, praying to the heavens he will never have to see them again. He cannot do this. It is all too much.</p>
      
      <p>How long has he lived for now? Over two thousand years? Almost three thousand? An eternity could pass and his mistakes will continue to haunt him.</p>
      
      <p>For the rest of the afternoon, he moves automatically, not paying attention to his surroundings. Even Sizhui's light conversation is nothing but background noise inside his head; he responds as he usually does, but Xichen's mind is elsewhere. It is stuck in the past.</p>
      
      <p>He thinks back to how Meng Yao smiled at him today. Is there a difference between him and Jin Guangyao? If someone's memories are different, does that change who they are as a person?</p>
      
      <p>Xichen does not know‚Äîbut perhaps it is no longer his business to know. He will stay away from Meng Yao here, and also Nie Mingjue. He will not allow himself to slip as he had done today.</p>
      
      <p>It is the sensible thing to do, the <em>only</em> thing he can do.</p>
      
      <p>But why does it hurt so much?</p>
      
      <p>He cannot forget the times he spent sat down with Jin Guangyao, drinking tea and discussing irrelevant things that made the two of them smile and laugh. After Mingjue-xiong's death, the hole he left behind was never quite filled. It did not feel right to drink tea without his presence, even if their final days as a three were filled with fights and arguments between the other two.</p>
      
      <p>Still, A-Yao's presence was a growing comfort throughout the years. Xichen trusted him with his life.</p>
      
      <p>Therefore, when he found Huaisang's letter revealing all of A-Yao's crimes, Xichen felt his world crumbling before his eyes. He did not want to believe it, but he could not <em>ignore</em> it either. All of the pieces lay before him; he was the only one capable of putting them together. How could he ignore such a burden?</p>
      
      <p>As much as he hated himself for doubting him, Xichen set about to discover things for himself. He did not say a word to Wangji, or his uncle. He needed answers first; he would decide what course of action he would take after he saw the evidence with his own eyes.</p>
      
      <p>For all of the secrets he kept, A-Yao trusted Xichen enough with his treasure room. He had often seen his sworn brother entering and leaving it through his mirror, but Xichen, being the polite man that he was, never dared to touch it himself. Lanling Jin Sect's secrets and treasures were not in his interest. He only visited Koi Tower for A-Yao's company.</p>
      
      <p>That day, he visited for the secrets. Once A-Yao left to tend to some matters, Xichen examined the mirror. As he expected, the Jin sect leader protected it with a barrier that only allowed its owner to enter.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen was a strong cultivator, the highest ranked in his generation. On top of that, he was well versed with talismans and magical spells; it was no trouble breaching through the barrier at all. He managed to create a space large enough for him to slip inside, disappearing into the ripples of the mirror.</p>
      
      <p>Once inside, the oil lamps on the walls ignited on their own, illuminating his path with an eerie, amber glow. Xichen walked into the darkness, observing the towering shelves stacked with books, stones, and weapons. He was not surprised to find instruments of torture hanging on the walls; he knew long ago that A-Yao gained Wen Ruohan's trust with his knowledge of the macabre. Even so, staring at them made Xichen uneasy. Iron manacles, spikes, silver hooks... There was even an iron table in the centre of the room, crusted with dried blood. Xichen did not need to guess what that was used for.</p>
      
      <p>He could not imagine A-Yao using this room. The A-Yao he knew was gentle, innocent. He would only resort to such deeds if he had a viable reason... He <em>must</em> have had a reason for all these crimes.</p>
      
      <p><em>Open your eyes and see him for the man that he is</em>, Nie Huaisang had written in his letter. <em>Jin Guangyao killed my brother.</em></p>
      
      <p>Repeating those words in his head, Xichen walked towards the treasure cabinet. With trembling hands, he lifted the curtain and looked at what was hidden behind.</p>
      
      <p>He staggered back.</p>
      
      <p>Everything he had ever believed in was shattering before his eyes. Meng Yao's kind eyes; gone, the promises all three of them uttered at their brotherhood ceremony; gone, the countless times he defended Jin Guangyao, <em>again and again;</em> gone. Xichen could no longer deny the truth, not when Nie Mingjue's face was right in front of him; dead, sealed, beheaded.</p>
      
      <p>His hands flew to cover his mouth. Tears welled up in his eyes, covering the sight of his sworn brother. His head was a pallid grey; eyes, ears, and mouth all sewn shut. There were numerous talismans attached to him, rendering him useless in this hidden room.</p>
      
      <p>But it was him. It was Nie Mingjue, their eldest sworn brother, who supposedly died of Qi Deviation; now cut into pieces and imprisoned in A-Yao's torture chambers.</p>
      
      <p>Footsteps echoed behind him.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen spun around. Jin Guangyao's face was devoid of its smile for once.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúA-Yao, explain the meaning of this!‚Äù Xichen demanded, his voice resounding through the darkness. ‚ÄúWhy would you have Mingjue-xiong's... <em>Why</em>...‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Guangyao's eyes softened.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI trust you with my life, Er-ge; do you not trust me?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>I do. I did.</em></p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúUncle, are you okay?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>A hand lightly shakes his arm. Xichen jumps, blinking back into the present. In front of him, Sizhui is gazing with concern. He clutches his head and looks around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings of his own apartment. He can smell the faint aroma of hot pot coming from the kitchen, reminding him he should have finished preparing dinner ages ago.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI... I am okay,‚Äù Xichen says, rising up from his seat. He hears a faint <em>buzz</em> from his nephew's pocket. ‚ÄúYour phone is ringing, Sizhui.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Sizhui fumbles through his pockets. ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>As his nephew gets distracted talking to whoever is calling him, Xichen makes himself busy in the kitchen. He pushes aside all of his thoughts about the past, focusing his attention on preparing the rest of the vegetables for dinner. Sizhui's presence is a blessing. Xichen listens to the idle chatter, refusing to remember his encounter with his sworn brothers today.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p class="center">- x -</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Of all the times Jin Ling decides to call his damn friend, he chooses to do it at four fucking AM. Jiang Cheng groans, grabbing a nearby pillow and covering his ears with it. Sharing a penthouse with Jin Ling and his dad is a nightmare. The suite is large enough to accommodate two whole families, but that's useless if you can still hear Jin Ling from the other side of the room when you're trying to get some sleep.</p>
      
      <p>It doesn't help he's put the phone on speaker. <em>Of course</em> he fucking has.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúSizhui, what time is it there now?‚Äù Jin Ling asks, his voice booming through the suite.</p>
      
      <p>From his bed, Jin Zixuan groans. He rolls over to his side, somehow still fast asleep even though his son may as well be yelling down his ear beside him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúUm, it's just past five PM.‚Äù Jiang Cheng hears Jin Ling's friend reply. ‚ÄúIsn't it four in the morning there?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, I'm still jetlagged. Where are you?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm with Uncle Xichen. My dad's gone with Teacher Wei to Ohio, I think.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p><em>‚ÄúEh?‚Äù</em> Jin Ling sits up, turning to where Jiang Cheng is lying on the couch. ‚ÄúUncle, did you hear that?! Teacher Wei's bringing Sizhui's dad with him!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng rises too, gripping the pillow. He wants to chuck it at Jin Ling, but knowing his luck, he'll hit Jin Zixuan instead.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúKeep your voice down, I'm trying to sleep!‚Äù Jiang Cheng snaps, swinging his legs over the couch. ‚ÄúWho are you even calling at this time?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling shows his phone to him when he joins his side. He's video calling his friend, who is now waving shyly at Jiang Cheng despite the deadly glare he throws at him. In the background, Jiang Cheng recognises the familiar paintings Xichen has in his apartment.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúUncle, you know Sizhui, right?‚Äù Jin Ling says.</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng spots Xichen in the background. Before he realises it, he's reaching for the phone.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHey, give me that.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling frowns at him, snatching the phone away and almost whacking Jin Zixuan in the face as he sleeps. It must be a miracle he still hasn't woken up.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI said give me your damn phone. I want to talk to Xichen!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Grumbling, Jin Ling hands it to him. ‚ÄúDon't be too long! International calls are expensive!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYour dad is rich, who gives a shit?‚Äù Jiang Cheng says, then narrows his eyes at Sizhui on the screen. ‚ÄúOi, you, let me talk to your uncle.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The kid nods and does exactly that. Within seconds, Jiang Cheng sees Xichen's confused face greeting him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúJiang Cheng? Is that you?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng nods, walking away from the bed. He goes outside onto the balcony and allows the cold air to wake him up.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDid you... need anything?‚Äù Xichen asks.</p>
      
      <p>Shit. Now that he's supposed to say something, Jiang Cheng's brain blanks out on him. Did Jin Ling have to use video call? This would be easier if he didn't have to stare at Xichen while talking.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, I... I wanted apologise for last time,‚Äù he forces out, finding it difficult to keep his eyes on the screen.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen shakes his head. ‚ÄúYou don't have to. It was my fault for prying.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNo. It's like you said; you were only trying to comfort me.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The corners of Xichen's lips lift up, though you could barely call it a smile. It looks more like a grimace. ‚ÄúI don't think it was a success though.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He's right. Jiang Cheng isn't used to people going out their way to try and comfort him though; instead of thanking the librarian, he lashed out on him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAre you in America now?‚Äù Xichen asks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYeah, I visited A-Jie earlier.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHow is she?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúShe's... okay for now. Hanging on.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI am glad. I hope you are feeling better.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Like last time, Xichen offers another smile that doesn't reach his eyes. He is constantly looking away too, sighing under his breath. They don't know each other that well yet, but even Jiang Cheng finds this behaviour a bit odd.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù he asks.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen raises an eyebrow. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou seem down.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúDo I? Hmm, I suppose I've had a tiring day... Is it that noticeable?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng shrugs. ‚ÄúUsually, you're always smiling and all that.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Right away, Xichen beams at him. It's surprising how convincing it looks; his eyes brighten up and his face is animated with the same friendly atmosphere Jiang Cheng is used to seeing.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIs that better?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng scoffs. ‚Äú<em>Tch</em>, you don't have to force it.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>For a second, Xichen's eyebrows raise. His smile falters until he finally relaxes. ‚ÄúThank you for your concern,‚Äù he quietly says.</p>
      
      <p>The gratitude in his voice catches the officer off. Jiang Cheng only said it as an offhanded comment, but it only occurs to him that, maybe, the librarian has been faking too many smiles. Xichen's life is none of his business and it's not in Jiang Cheng's nature to pry; anyhow, he's somewhat glad the librarian looks a bit better now.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúIs it not late there?‚Äù Xichen questions. ‚ÄúYou ought to rest, Officer.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI will in a bit.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHow long will you be there?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúJust a week. How come?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI'm just curious. It is odd not seeing you around.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng squints, hating the fact his cheeks heat up at that comment. ‚ÄúWhat's <em>that</em> supposed to mean?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen only laughs at his response. Although it livens him up a bit, he trails off with a sigh.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI met with Chief Nie and your brother-in-law today.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng frowns. ‚ÄúMeng Yao?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI didn't know you knew them.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI don't. I bumped into them in the caf√©.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Meng Yao and Chief Nie were seeing each other? Jiang Cheng knows those two had some strange history behind them, although he's never bothered to ask why. He doesn't <em>want</em> to know. Chief Nie is his boss and Meng Yao is annoying; whatever they have between them is none of Jiang Cheng's business.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHuh. Okay,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says. ‚ÄúI didn't know they were talking again.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen shrugs slightly, distractedly twisting a long strand of his hair around his fingers. His hair is loose for once; usually Jiang Cheng sees it up in either a bun or a ponytail.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúThey seemed fine, although they were bickering a lot. Do they fight often?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNot <em>big</em> fights. Chief Nie doesn't approve of Meng Yao's career as an actor, especially since his manager's an asshole.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>The librarian tilts his head. ‚ÄúHis manager? Who's that?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng looks up at the sky, trying to search his brain for a name. It's on the tip of his tongue but he's too tired to remember it.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI forgot his name. I just know Chief Nie hates him,‚Äù he says.</p>
      
      <p>Xichen slowly nods. ‚ÄúIsn't Chief Nie's younger brother an actor too? Does he not approve of that as well?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>At the mention of Huaisang, Jiang Cheng can't help but smirk. He hasn't seen Huaisang in <em>years</em>, not since they graduated from uni. He seems to be doing well though, what with him being a famous actor now. Good for him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúChief Nie doesn't approve of anything Huaisang does. Huaisang's mainly been acting as extras until now. I think Crimson Heart was his d√©but as a proper actor; same as Meng Yao,‚Äù Jiang Cheng explains. ‚ÄúWhy do you care so much anyway?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúNothing. Just curious.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúHmph. Didn't think you'd be into celebrity gossip.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen lets out another laugh. ‚ÄúHave <em>you</em> watched Crimson Heart?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚Äú<em>Me?</em> I don't watch that sappy shit.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI heard it's very good. We should watch it together, Officer.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng chokes. The amusement now dancing in Xichen's eyes tell him he's only joking but it doesn't stop the heated flush spreading onto Jiang Cheng's cheeks.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou're not getting me anywhere near that thing. Go watch it yourself!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen feigns a sigh. ‚ÄúYou're so cold.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Behind him, the balcony door slides open. Jiang Cheng turns around, seeing Jin Ling shuffle outside. ‚ÄúCan I get my phone back now?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jiang Cheng says nothing, glaring at his nephew.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou can call me on my phone, Officer.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He directs his glare at Xichen now. ‚ÄúWho says I want to call you? And I don't even have your number!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Ling taps his feet on the floor, folding his arms and rolling his eyes with attitude. ‚ÄúAsk for it, <em>duh</em>, Uncle.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúShut the fuck up, you brat!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Xichen chuckles. ‚ÄúI'll text it to Jin Ling in a bit so you can write it down, Officer.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou don't need to!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Just then, they hear the evident sound of Jin Zixuan groaning from inside the penthouse. ‚ÄúJiang Cheng, shut the fuck up and just accept whoever is giving you their number! Let me <em>sleep.‚Äù</em></p>
      
      <p>Not even the cold breeze outside is enough to cool down his heated face. Jiang Cheng shoves open the balcony doors and scowls at his brother-in-law.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúS-Stop listening in on our conversation!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Jin Zixuan copies his glare. ‚ÄúI don't want to but you've been talking for ages! Stop flirting and go!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Flirting? <em>Flirting?!</em> Jiang Cheng nearly throws the phone right into Jin Zixuan's annoying face. <em>Flirting? Him? What the fuck!</em></p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI-I'm not flirting! This isn't even‚Äî! I don't flirt with guys!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>To make things worse, Xichen is laughing. His voice resonates out of the phone, filling their penthouse.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou s-shut up!‚Äù Jiang Cheng yells at him. ‚ÄúI'm going!‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He ends the call in less than a second, chucking the phone back to Jin Ling. His nephew yells at him, demanding <em>why</em> he had to end the call when he wanted to talk to his friend afterwards. Jiang Cheng yells back, telling him to shut the fuck up and go to sleep. Of course, that only causes Jin Zixuan to snap at him, not at all happy his son is being spoken to in such a manner.</p>
      
      <p>It's a mess. All three of them staying in the same penthouse is a recipe for disaster.</p>
      
      <p>Even after all that, he still manages to get Xichen's number. The temptation to delete it is strong, but Jiang Cheng doesn't. It's only because Xichen lives in the same apartment as him anyway. It could be useful to contact him if he needs anything. <em>That's all.</em></p>

      <p>It is morning when they arrive in Ohio. Wei Ying slept for most of the flight, tucked into Wangji's arms. The carefree mood he was in yesterday significantly fades as soon as they land; the closer they get to the city, the quieter Wei Ying becomes until Wangji can do nothing but worry.</p>
      
      <p>They sit silently in the taxi. Wei Ying's eyes are fixed on the window, seeing something Wangji cannot. He is nibbling on his bottom lip, sometimes wincing at buildings that pass them. It is obvious there are memories in this place that plagues Wei Ying, and the fact that Wangji has no idea what they are is maddening. He searches in his head for something to say, but Wangji has never been an expert of filling in silence. That is Wei Ying's talent.</p>
      
      <p>After some time, Wei Ying turns away from the window, sighing.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWei Ying?‚Äù Wangji calls.</p>
      
      <p>The teacher inhales a deep breath, leaning into Wangji. As if by habit now, Wangji wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him closer. If he cannot find the words to comfort Wei Ying, then he will make sure he can at least show him he is here. They remain like that for a while. Wei Ying runs his hand up Wangji's chest, often fiddling with the collar of his shirt. Wangji stays still, simply watching him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúLan Zhan, if you weren't here with me now, I think I'd be freaking out,‚Äù Wei Ying mutters.</p>
      
      <p>Wangji holds him tighter. ‚ÄúI am here.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Wei Ying says. ‚ÄúI'm glad.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>For the rest of the journey to their hotel, they do not say anything. Wangji no longer feels it is necessary; Wei Ying has calmed down in his arms, busying himself by playing with their fingers. He compares their hands together, laughing softly at how small his looks against the Wangji's.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúYou know... Last time I was here, I was by myself,‚Äù Wei Ying says. His voice is quiet, muffled by Wangji's chest. ‚ÄúYou said you went to America too, didn't you? Did you go with your brother?‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji shakes his head. ‚ÄúI was alone.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>He had been scouring the world for any clue of where Wei Ying could be, if he would ever return; it feels like a miracle now that he should come back here with the very same man curled against him.</p>
      
      <p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Wei Ying says, sitting up and grinning at him. ‚ÄúGood thing we have each other this time.‚Äù</p>
      
      <p>Wangji nods, tucking a stray hair behind Wei Ying's ear. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he says.</p>
      
      <p>It is impossible not to smile back.</p>
