    <h3>Monotone</h3>

    <div class="fic-text">
      <p><em>For the immortal loved the human</em> <em>so much that she would give up her heart for him, </em>his mother said, smiling at the small frown playing on his face. <em>She remained forever lost in the sea of stars where even legends forgot her name.</em></p>

      <p><em>That's silly, </em>he huffed. He did not enjoy sad endings. He wanted a different story, one where everyone lived happily ever after. Those were the endings he liked best. He saw no point in stories that did not end in that way.</p>

      <p><em>She loved him,</em> his mother repeated. <em>What is so silly about that?</em></p>

      <p><em>He forgot about her. She was sad in the end!</em></p>

      <p>His mother let out a laugh that filled their entire house. She hugged him closer and kissed his scowl away.</p>

      <p><em>When you love someone, you'd do anything for them, </em>she said, holding him tighter. <em>You would give them the sun, the moon, and the stars if you could.</em></p>

      <p>He looked up at her, still frowning at her words. <em>Even if it makes you sad?</em></p>

      <p><em>Yes, </em>she said. <em>That's when you know you love them; because you can't stop, even if it makes you sad.</em></p>

      <p>The only thing he could do was scrunch up his face even more and listen to his mother laugh again and again. Wei Ying didn't understand what she had meant by that, not yet.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Did you ever understand?</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In another time more distant than that of the stars, he stood there, surrounded by faces of the dead. All he heard in this barren land were the shouts of men who had fought alongside him once. Now, they rushed into the battlefield to spill his blood and put an end to all of this.</p>

      <p>It didn't scare him. Not now. Not anymore. There was nothing left for him. He had lost everything and everyone he had ever loved, and all that remained was this heavy weight in his chest he wished would go away. He couldn't protect his family, he couldn't protect the Wens, he couldn't even destroy the Stygian Tiger Seal. There was nothing left to be done, nothing left he <em>could</em> do.</p>

      <p>Wei Wuxian faced his death with a smile on his face; a fitting way for someone who had long stopped looking for happy endings. When the corpses tore apart at his flesh, all he understood was that life was tiring, and he was glad it was finally over.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Do you understand now?</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>He had never wanted to come back. If everyone believed he was a deranged man whose own creations killed him in the end, then so be it. If his death meant that everyone was at peace, then so be it. He was tired of fighting. He was tired of <em>living</em>. He didn't want to come back.</p>

      <p><em>That</em> was the plan.</p>

      <p>Somehow, after the course of centuries, years that he spent in silence and nothing but silence, he came back. He came back, and he lived. He met those that he knew in his old life, and he hurt them again, just as he had done before. He made the same mistakes‚Äîbecause humans do that; they make mistakes and they move on.</p>

      <p>He loved<em>‚Äî</em></p>

      <p>He <em>loved.</em></p>

      <p>And now, he also understood.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Was it worth it?</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The sky was the same as it had been that night he first died. Wei Wuxian did not see a single star above him when his corpses ripped him apart, and Wei Ying was greeted with a similar void as the bullet tore into his body.</p>

      <p>But that was the only similarity between the two.</p>

      <p>Wei Wuxian died feeling the weight of life leave him. He welcomed it, satisfied that he could finally have a rest after this long, long war. Everything‚Äî<em>everyone</em> would be better off without him in their lives.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying did not want to die. He thought of the people he was leaving behind and a selfish part of him clung onto them. He didn't want to lose everything again. Not now. <em>Not this time.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Remember.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>A flash of light, and a surge of colour and galaxies. Buried memories of blood and war resurface, whispering words into his head that make no sense.</p>

      <p>Sunshot Campaign. Yiling Patriarch. Demonic cultivation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Remember.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Yunmeng Jiang. Qinghe Nie. Gusu Lan. Lanling Jin. Qishan Wen.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Remember.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>A home by the pier. Swimming amidst lotus blooms and laughing at Jiang Cheng's outraged cries, telling him to stop slacking off. The taste of shijie's cooking, the softness in her eyes. The gentle weight of Uncle Jiang's hand as he lays it on his head, smiling down at him while Jiang Cheng pretends not to see. Madam Yu's sharp voice, demanding that he protect his brother with his life; the one thing she has only ever asked of him.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Remember.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Golden eyes and white robes. Days spent by his side, copying endless rules that span on for eternity; memories untouched by war and safely tucked within. Then, a cave. A quiet song that lulls him to sleep, the warmth of a lap under his head‚Äîbut it must be his imagination. Lan Wangji would never offer his lap.</p>

      <p>War, and war, and war. Amidst it all, a voice, begging him.</p>

      <p><em>Come back to Gusu with me.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Remember.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Gnawing power that eats at his sanity the more he summons those monsters. Responsibility; heavier than any blow of the punishments he endured in Gusu. Jiang Cheng's irritated scowls slowly turning into hatred, his words laced with threats. Anger, only anger; anger at this war, anger at everyone who didn't understand, anger at <em>himself. </em>Mostly himself.</p>

      <p>The public stirs. Their fear multiplies and he is alone, more than ever. Above their scorn, he hears <em>that</em> voice as always, repeating the same request that tears him from the inside.</p>

      <p><em>Come back to Gusu with me.</em></p>

      <p>It is easier to say no when his heart wants to accept. If he can return to the days where laughter came easy and Lan Wangji did not look at him as if he was a monster, he would‚Äîbut he cannot, and that is why he says no. He hates that he must refuse and he hates that it is a difficult decision to begin with. Most of all, he hates Lan Wangji for asking. He hates that he makes this harder than it has to be. He <em>hates</em> Lan Wangji.</p>

      <p>(He doesn't, but it is easier to hate than to admit he misses him.)</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Do you want to come back?</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><em>Yes, </em>he thinks. <em>I want to go home.</em></p>

      <p>Lotus Pier? The Burial Mounds? Gusu? A run-down apartment, somewhere in the outskirts of the city?</p>

      <p>A small house, ransacked by intruders while he hides in a closet, muffling the sounds of his cries?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center"><em>Wake up.</em></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>He wakes up, and it's too, too bright. For a second, he wonders how he could have survived the siege, because this sudden brightness can only mean that morning has risen and today is a new day. The corpses would have ripped him to pieces, and if that didn't happen, then someone would have found him and finished the job. No one would have wanted to miss such an opportunity.</p>

      <p>His eyes adjust to the blaring light. He's not in the Burial Mounds at all.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou're awake.‚Äù A woman's voice. ‚ÄúOr should I say you're <em>alive.</em>‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sits up so quickly that his head spins. <em>Alive? </em>That can't be possible. He was supposed to die.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWhere...?‚Äù His voice trails off as he takes in the place he's supposedly in. No, this isn't the Burial Mounds. He's never seen this place at all in his entire lifetime.</p>

      <p>It's a cottage, he thinks, and a very small one at that. The different scents of herbs mixing with each other tickle his nostrils and he resists the urge to sneeze. He's on a bed with a woman sitting beside him, her dark eyes staring so intently that Wei Ying almost mistakes her for a statue.</p>

      <p>Unnerved by her gazing, he's the first to look away. It's only now that he notices there's another person here, perched on a chair and completely unconscious. He has short hair and wide shoulders. From this angle, it's difficult to see his face; Wei Ying can only make out the paleness of his skin.</p>

      <p>He is also covered in blood, which is not a good sign at all.</p>

      <p>So far, Wei Ying deduces that he's woken up in an unknown cottage with a woman who won't stop staring at him, and an unconscious guy who may, or may not, be dead.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI... I died,‚Äù he says, more to himself than to the woman who is <em>still</em> staring.</p>

      <p>She nods, sitting back. ‚ÄúYou did.‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>Did?</em></p>

      <p>‚ÄúThe siege... I was at Burial Mounds.‚Äù</p>

      <p>The woman raises an eyebrow, as if waiting for him to continue. When he says nothing more, her eyebrows furrow together into a deep frown. ‚ÄúIs that all you remember?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Should he remember <em>more?</em></p>

      <p>Confused, Wei Ying looks around the room again. That man is still unconscious, and it becomes hard to tell if he's actually breathing or not. Wei Ying is starting to worry that he may actually be dead.</p>

      <p>He doesn't know what possesses him to move. He swings his legs over the bed and makes his way towards the man, ducking down to get a good view of his face.</p>

      <p>He notices several things at once.</p>

      <p>He's no longer wearing his robes. His head feels light, and when he runs a hand through his hair‚Äîit's gone‚Äîor rather, it's <em>short. </em>And this man‚Äî</p>

      <p><em>His face</em>‚Äî</p>

      <p>Wei Ying jerks back as if he's been stung. Even with the strange haircut, he would know that face from a mile away.</p>

      <p><em>Lan Zhan</em>.</p>

      <p>Sudden pain pulses in his temples. Wei Ying clutches his head and squeezes his eyes shut. Behind closed eyelids, he sees a flash‚Äîgolden eyes, Lan Zhan with short hair, shaking him.</p>

      <p><em>Stay awake. Stay with me.</em></p>

      <p>Then, it's gone. He's back in the cottage. The woman has stood up, her lips moving and her eyebrows still knitted together. She says something, but Wei Ying hears nothing but the drumming of his heartbeat. Everything is closing in.</p>

      <p>His last memory is of the siege.</p>

      <p><em>No‚Äî</em></p>

      <p>A skyscraper. A gunshot. Lan Zhan holding him in his arms, begging him to stay awake.</p>

      <p><em>No.</em></p>

      <p>He was alone when he died; his only company were the corpses that ate his every flesh and bone.</p>

      <p><em>No!</em></p>

      <p>A cry lodges itself in his throat. He buries his hands in his hair and gasps at the pain that's tearing his head apart. This isn't right. This doesn't make <em>sense</em>.</p>

      <p>He died‚Äîbut when? How? There are different memories that swim in his head, and it becomes impossible to put them in order. What's the last thing that he remembers?</p>

      <p>It's not the siege. He remembers... a voice, telling him to wake up. He remembers dreaming‚Äîor at least he thought it was a dream.</p>

      <p><em>Remember, </em>the voice had said. <em>Wake up.</em></p>

      <p>‚ÄúI need to go,‚Äù he says, stumbling back.</p>

      <p>The woman does not move, not even when he's rushing towards the door. ‚ÄúGo where?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying hates that he stops. That's right; where exactly can he go? Home? At the thought of home, he thinks of a small house near the countryside, hardly big enough to fit a family. He thinks of a dark closet, and the nightmares that accompany it. He thinks of a kitchen and a table, and on that table are two cups left untouched. The swirling liquid inside those cups will make you forget everything. Wei Ying didn't dare take a sip in his dream.</p>

      <p>What's going on? Why does it feel like his head is splitting in two?</p>

      <p>He sneaks another glance at Lan Zhan, but it's not long until he has to look away.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI need... I need to go,‚Äù he repeats. He needs to <em>think</em>, and he can't think here with all these questions in the air.</p>

      <p>He stumbles out of the cottage and hears nothing more from the woman. She doesn't stop him, nor does she call out. In the back of Wei Ying's mind, he thinks he should probably know her, but the dark voids of her black eyes unsettle him. This whole situation unsettles him.</p>

      <p>He breathes in the cold air, gazing up at the sky that greets him in return. He's not sure what he should have expected when he stepped out of the cottage. Maybe Burial Mounds, waiting for him, littered with corpses and resentful energy. Maybe home‚Äîwherever that is, if it still exists.</p>

      <p>Instead, he's faced with the towering trees of a forest piercing into the skies. It's not an unfamiliar sight. He recalls nights running through similar forests, followed by the unresting growls of his fierce corpses.</p>

      <p>But this place... This place is too quiet. Too peaceful. It feels like a lifetime since he has heard silence this loud.</p>

      <p><em>A lifetime.</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying lets out a bemused scoff at that. He runs a hand through his hair, half expecting it to trail down to his waist. When it stops just below his jaw, he sighs and drops his arms limply back to his sides. <em>Right</em>, he thinks. <em>It has been a lifetime.</em></p>

      <p>He looks down, trying to ignore the thundering pace of his pulse. In all honesty, it feels like he's woken up from a very strange dream. Now that he's awake, everything is starting to slip away from him and the more he tries to remember, the harder it becomes. His brain desperately wants to convince him that it <em>is</em> all just a dream. It would be best to forget about it and move on.</p>

      <p>If it <em>is</em> real, then...</p>

      <p>He's got a <em>massive</em> headache.</p>

      <p>Groaning, Wei Ying closes his eyes and tries his best to remember what happened before he woke up. He remembers the two cups on that table; the ones that the dead drink before moving onto the next life. It made sense. No one wants to be weighed down by the past.</p>

      <p>Is that why he's getting hit with both memories from the past and the present? Because he <em>didn't</em> drink it?</p>

      <p><em>You died, </em>he tells himself. There's no use pretending it was all a dream. <em>You died, and now you're back. Now you remember the life you had when you were still a cultivator.</em></p>

      <p>Somehow, admitting it doesn't help at all. Wei Ying lays a hand on his stomach, right above the place where he got shot. He's still wearing the same clothes, covered in blood. It's a good thing they're in the middle of nowhere because if anybody saw him like this, they would think he had walked straight out of a horror movie.</p>

      <p><em>I died,</em> he repeats. <em>I'm Wei Wuxian, the Yiling Patriarch. I'm Wei Ying, high school teacher. I'm alive.</em></p>

      <p>He swallows the lump in his throat and looks back at the cottage. A cold breeze sweeps over the forest, brushing goosebumps over his arms.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan is there.</p>

      <p><em>Lan Zhan. </em>The same Lan Zhan he met under the moonlight, glaring at him with a scowl that had once made Wei Ying throw his head back and laugh for all the world to hear. The same Lan Zhan who didn't approve of his demonic cultivation. The same Lan Zhan who bought countless toys for A-Yuan, just because he wanted to, just because he was kind like that.</p>

      <p>The same Lan Zhan who adopted Sizhui as his own son. The same Lan Zhan who could barely use his iPhone, not knowing how to unlock it without looking like a caveman. The same Lan Zhan who watched all movies of Shrek with him in one afternoon, even though he clearly didn't appreciate it as much as Wei Ying had. The same Lan Zhan who helped him find the courage to visit Jiejie again.</p>

      <p>The same Lan Zhan who's always been there, right from the very beginning.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sighs. The silence of this forest is too thick. There is no more war, no more strange gangs abducting him out of nowhere. Now, there's... nothing. Just silence. Peace.</p>

      <p>He doesn't know what comes next, not when it feels like he's got two lifetimes at war with each other, trying to decide who he is exactly. He wants to run back to that cottage and shake Lan Zhan awake‚Äîbut the other half of him is telling him to stop; the one who's still reeling from the Sunshot Campaign, the one who remembers the siege like it was yesterday.</p>

      <p><em>Lan Zhan doesn't hate me, </em>he wants to scream at that part. <em>He's never hated me.</em></p>

      <p><em>No, he's loved you all this time, </em>it says.<em> He loves the Wei Wuxian from the past. Are you even the same one he cared for? Or is this just him not being able to move on?</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying glares at the ground, kicking the branches at his feet. He hates that he doesn't know what to say about that. Most of all, he hates that it's a question to begin with.</p>

      <p>He stands there, not knowing whether to barge back into that cottage or just <em>run. </em>In the end, he stays rooted on the spot, waiting for an answer. For anything.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The door to Jiang Cheng's apartment is unlocked. There's no noise that comes from within when Xichen knocks, but he knows he is in there. He contemplates leaving him alone, not wishing to disturb the police officer who must already have enough to worry about without Xichen inviting himself into his own home. For a few seconds, his hand hovers above the door handle. He thinks about returning to his own apartment, hounded by his own thoughts and worries.</p>

      <p>Xichen grips the handle and opens the door.</p>

      <p>He doesn't find Jiang Cheng straight away. What he <em>does</em> find is that his apartment is a mess; there are unwashed dishes on every surface, discarded books, and clothes left on the floor. Usually, Jiang Cheng hates his apartment being in such a disorganized state. He is quicker to anger when his surroundings are untidy.</p>

      <p>Walking further into the apartment, it's not long until he finds Jiang Cheng. The balcony door is open, and there is the police officer, his back turned to him as he leans on the railings and looks down at the view below. Xichen smells the faint waft of smoke from outside.</p>

      <p>Jin Ling once told him that Jiang Cheng only smoked whenever he was stressed. Given the state of his home and the recent circumstances that have happened, Xichen is not surprised to find him smoking now.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng doesn't turn around, but Xichen sees him putting out his cigarette.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he asks. His voice is gravelly, as if he has not used it in a while. Jiang Cheng lightly coughs under his breath before finally turning around to face him.</p>

      <p>There are bags under his eyes. Xichen does his best to ignore the red rims around them, knowing that Jiang Cheng will only be angry if someone points out that he has been crying.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI wanted to make sure you were okay,‚Äù Xichen slowly says.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng scoffs. There are the makings of a scowl on his face, disappearing before it reaches his eyes. He shakes his head to himself, only looking more tired than he already does.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou're the only who almost died,‚Äù he says.</p>

      <p>He is trying to direct the conversation away from him, Xichen notices. He allows it to happen.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI'm alive,‚Äù he says. The words taste bitter on his tongue. <em>Alive, </em>but without a core. <em>Alive, </em>for how long?</p>

      <p>As if sensing his tone, Jiang Cheng turns back to the balcony. Silence passes between them, thick and uncertain. After a while, Xichen joins him, leaning against the railings and taking in the view of the city below them. Everything resumes as normal. To everyone else, it is another day.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHave you found them?‚Äù Jiang Cheng asks.</p>

      <p>Xichen keeps his eyes trained on the ant-sized cars driving through the streets.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says, voice as quiet as a whisper. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng doesn't say anything. In the corner of his eyes, Xichen sees him gripping the railings tighter.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù he adds on.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighs. ‚ÄúYour brother's disappeared with Wei Ying's body and hasn't been seen in two days. What do you want me to say?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen winces. ‚ÄúHe will come back, and...‚Äù</p>

      <p>And what?</p>

      <p>He does not know what goes through Wangji's mind these days and it's <em>frustrating</em> feeling this useless. He cannot even try to look for him no matter how hard he tried. When Xichen had his core, the world felt so small with everything, anything, in reach. Now, <em>he</em> feels small. All he can do is wait for Wangji to return.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúAfter everything I've seen, I don't know what to expect anymore,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHave you... Have you told your sister?‚Äù Xichen asks. The grimace on Jiang Cheng's face is enough of an answer. ‚ÄúOr anyone?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWei Ying's friends <em>kind of</em> know. Wen Qing stormed into the station yesterday. I had to tell her Wei Ying was missing.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen does not miss the way he has purposely avoided the question about his sister. He nods, resisting the urge to sigh. ‚ÄúJust missing?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's eyebrows knit together. His voice becomes quiet, hardly audible through the wind that chills them. ‚ÄúI think part of me is hoping your brother will find a way to bring him back.‚Äù</p>

      <p>It's now that Jiang Cheng chooses to look at him, but for the life of him, Xichen cannot meet his eyes after that sentence. He keeps his gaze on the city below, knowing that Jiang Cheng is waiting for an answer.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIs it possible?‚Äù Jiang Cheng says after a while. ‚ÄúYou're both immortal, aren't you? I saw what you could do...‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>Not anymore,</em> Xichen almost says. <em>I'm not immortal anymore.</em></p>

      <p>He swallows those words down. ‚ÄúI have never seen anyone return from the dead... At least, not in a human state.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng's frown deepens. He opens his mouth as if he's going to snap or curse, though quickly closes it with a frustrated sigh.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI haven't told A-Jie yet,‚Äù he says instead. Xichen tries not to show his relief at the change of subject. ‚ÄúI don't know if I can.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Now, he faces Jiang Cheng. ‚ÄúAnd Jin Ling? Have you told him?‚Äù</p>

      <p>He has not seen Jin Ling in a while. For now, he is staying with Sizhui in their uncle's home. Lan Qiren was not happy to find that Wangji had disappeared, and he was less happier when Xichen evaded all of his questions. It was a miracle he even agreed to take care of Sizhui and Jin Ling while they waited for Wangji to return.</p>

      <p>Xichen had been hoping to muster the courage to tell his uncle that his core was gone. As of yet, he has not been successful with that.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHe thinks Wei Ying is missing. I told him not to tell his parents yet...‚Äù Jiang Cheng says. ‚ÄúA-Jie is still in hospital. The doctors said she can leave soon; I don't want to make her worry in case it puts a strain on her recovery.‚Äù</p>

      <p>The way he talks quickly feels as if he is trying to fit the reasons in time, before Xichen can wonder <em>why</em> he has chosen to lie to his family instead.</p>

      <p>But it is not as though Xichen is any different. He has refused to tell Sizhui and his uncle the truth yet. He cannot even bear to look at them.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI see,‚Äù he says.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHave you spoken with Meng Yao? And Chief Nie?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen blinks, instantly hit with the memory of Meng Yao pointing that gun at him. The gunshot, piercing through that room, and then‚ÄîWen Ruohan, dead on the floor.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Xichen stiffly answers. After they left the casino, Meng Yao and everyone involved with the gang had been taken into custody. He has not heard any news about them as of yet. He is not sure whether that is a relief or not.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúThey're still questioning Meng Yao, you know.‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Xichen pushes aside the curiosity betraying him. ‚ÄúWhat about Wen Xu?‚Äù</p>

      <p>If Jiang Cheng noticed him avoiding that topic, he did not show it.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúStill in custody as well. He's not really resisting though.‚Äù Jiang Cheng shrugs. ‚ÄúI think he wanted to be caught. I don't think he liked working under his father.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Slowly, Xichen nods. He bites the inside of his cheek, hating that he cannot shake off the lingering part of him that cares. ‚ÄúWhat are they going to do with Meng Yao?‚Äù he asks, cursing his inability to move on and forget.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI don't know... He wasn't actually part of Wen Ruohan's gang, but he knew about them.‚Äù Jiang Cheng turns to him, nudging his elbow lightly. ‚ÄúI think you should talk to him. Chief Nie too.‚Äù</p>

      <p>How funny that he should say that, when he is also unable to talk to his own family. Xichen cannot stop himself from smiling. ‚ÄúIt seems we're both trying to avoid what we must face.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng scowls at him for that, but says nothing more. Silence falls between them once again. This time, it is less stifling. Xichen is quite glad he has sought Jiang Cheng out today; being stuck in his own apartment with his thoughts spiralling around him was tiring. He is still at a loss as to what to do, but the company is helpful, even just for a bit.</p>

      <p>Perhaps when he returns home, he will tell his uncle that he has lost his core. Although mortal, his uncle has not changed too much from what he used to be. He will be disappointed, surely, but there is little that can be done about the situation. At most, Xichen is used to disappointing his uncle. Memories of his seclusion are still ripe on his mind, even if it had been over thousands and thousands of years ago. Lan Qiren had spent much of that time watching him from a distance, reminding him that he was wasting his life away.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúTell me about your life,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says, breaking the silence. Xichen blinks, not expecting the request. ‚ÄúYou said you've been alive for almost three thousand years. What did you... do?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he answers automatically. ‚ÄúWe blended in with humanity and tried not to bring attention to ourselves. We... lived.‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúFor all those years?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stands up straighter, no longer leaning on the railings. ‚ÄúDoesn't it get repetitive? You're just... staying like <em>this </em>forever<em>.</em>‚Äù He gestures at Xichen from head to toe. ‚ÄúI... I can't get it round my head. Part of me still thinks you're spouting bullshit.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen bitterly smiles. ‚ÄúI've stopped counting the years. At some point, you grow numb to it. There was nothing left for us but to live.‚Äù</p>

      <p>For the first hundred or so years, he counted. He'd wake up every new year and think <em>this is the hundred and thirty-fifth year</em>, and so on and so forth. As the centuries passed, he lost count. Had it been four hundred and twenty years? Or four hundred and nineteen? In time, he found that it did not matter. Why was he counting? What good did it do, aside from remind him how tired he was?</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou can't die?‚Äù Jiang Cheng asks.</p>

      <p>Xichen shakes his head. ‚ÄúI <em>could. </em>If I slit open my throat with a blade, I would die. If I jumped off a height that is tall enough to kill me, I would die. I would be lying if I said I had not thought of trying<em>...</em> but I always stopped.‚Äù</p>

      <p>He remembers standing atop a building, staring at a view so similar to this one. He had long forgotten what year that was, but time had always mattered little. All that he knew was that if he took one step forward, then all of time would cease for him. It would all be over. There was some comfort in that thought.</p>

      <p>Yet, no matter how welcoming it seemed, Xichen could not bring himself to take that final step. He would spend many days returning to that same spot, staring down at the world that could not see him. He would stand there for hours, weighing each consequence in his head, and silently leave just as day turned into dusk.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stirs, clearly uncomfortable by his words. ‚ÄúWhy? What made you stop?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI didn't want to leave my brother,‚Äù Xichen says. It is always the answer that comes first with this question. ‚ÄúAlso, I was... waiting for something else. Something more.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng tilts his head. ‚ÄúWaiting? For what?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen stares at the blue hues of Jiang Cheng's eyes and wonders about the answer to that. In truth, he has never admitted this out loud. He has avoided admitting it to <em>himself</em>, let alone another person. It is easier to live life for so long when you try to avoid thinking about it entirely.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúPerhaps some proof that it was all worth it in the end. A reward for not giving up. It is na√Øve, but...‚Äù Xichen sighs, his lips tugging up into a tired smile. The memory of standing at the edge of that building is suddenly stronger. ‚ÄúIt's impossible to ignore the small chance that, somewhere in the future, I may find a reason as to why I have lived this long. Something that will make me look back on all these years and think <em>this </em>is it. This is what I have been waiting for, and it was all worth it.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng is quiet, staring down at the bustling city below them. The faint sounds of the morning rush is oddly comforting now. Back then, Xichen would stare at a similar view, listening to the same sounds‚Äîand he would envy it. He would wish to be among that crowd, living his life unburdened and free.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHave you found it?‚Äù Jiang Cheng asks.</p>

      <p>Xichen takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù he admits. ‚ÄúIn any case, I am no longer immortal. Wen Zhuliu melted my core. I'm... I'm like you now.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Facing him again, Jiang Cheng raises an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou make that sound like it's a bad thing.‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>Is it? </em>Xichen thinks to himself. In a way, it feels as if it is. He does not like this uncertainty. After an eternity of accepting his immortality, the prospect of living normally is utterly impossible for him. It is almost laughable.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI've grown used to this endless eternity. Life was...‚Äù He stops, struggling to find a word that summarises this existence they have called their lives; waking up everyday, simply existing because it is all that is left, wondering if this will ever change, or end‚Äîwhichever comes first. Squinting at the brightness of the morning sun, Xichen gazes up at the sky and finds the word. ‚ÄúLife was monotone, but it was all we had.‚Äù</p>

      <p>The skies dim as clouds loom at the edges of the sun. He stares back down at his hands. ‚ÄúNow I don't know what's left for me.‚Äù</p>

      <p>It seems silly worrying about this when he should consider it a blessing. After all, had he not entertained the thought of dying before? Did he not think of immortality as a curse? Why does the thought of a mortal life intimidate him now?</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIt's still the same. Just because you're not magical or immortal doesn't mean that life will be any more different,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says. He motions towards the city below them. ‚ÄúYou'll still wake up, go to work, talk to your family and friends. Life will still be monotone.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen smiles. ‚Äú<em>You</em> make that sound like it's a bad thing.‚Äù</p>

      <p>There is a glint of amusement in Jiang Cheng's eyes. It is not quite as bright as usual, but it is there nonetheless. ‚ÄúIt's how you look at it, isn't it?‚Äù He shrugs. ‚ÄúSome days, I hate it; some days, I'm happy. That's just part of being human.‚Äù</p>

      <p>For the longest time, Xichen can only stare at Jiang Cheng and let his words sink in. He and Wangji have spent so long trying to blend in with humanity, while also categorising themselves as something different. No matter how much they tried to pretend they were human, they knew they could never be. Were they imitating or envying them?</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng makes him wonder if, maybe after all these years, they had been doing a better job of being human. Much more than they intended.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou're right,‚Äù he says. This time, the smile he gives is easier. It's real. ‚ÄúPerhaps Wangji and I are more human than we thought.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng returns the smile, although it barely lifts the corner of his lips. He quickly looks away, frowning at the distance.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWhat was... What was I like in the past?‚Äù he mumbles.</p>

      <p><em>Oh. </em>Xichen sees a flash of the Yunmeng Jiang sect leader, his scowl permanently etched on his young face. A boy who had been forced to grow up because of the war‚Äîjust as they all had. Back then, Xichen had nothing but respect for Jiang Cheng‚ÄîJiang <em>Wanyin</em>.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou were... not very different from what you are now. Proud, quick to anger... Although, I must admit you and I did not interact as much.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looks surprised by this. ‚ÄúReally? Why's that?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúOur paths seldom crossed. You were busy with your own responsibilities, and so was I.‚Äù</p>

      <p>After the siege took Wei Wuxian's life, Jiang Cheng dedicated much of his time to his sect. As the years passed, there were rumours that he hunted down demonic cultivators, convinced they could be Wei Wuxian returning from the dead. Many said those demonic cultivators no longer saw the light of day once they entered Lotus Pier.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI've had a few dreams where I'm running in a forest,‚Äù Jiang Cheng mutters. ‚ÄúI don't know if I'm running away from something or chasing it.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen frowns at that.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúBut I think I'm in danger. I think Jin Ling is also there.‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>A forest... </em>There were a lot of rumours surrounding Jiang Cheng. His unapproachable nature meant that people were more likely to spread gossip about him, mostly because the fear he incited also made for good stories. There was, however, a rumour about an incident he had during a night hunt. It was the last story ever told about him.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIs that something that happened to me in the past?‚Äù Jiang Cheng asks when Xichen does not respond. He leans closer. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that how I died?‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>Sect Leader Jiang was found dead during a night hunt, </em>the rumours said, <em>along with his nephew.</em></p>

      <p>It had been a lifetime ago, but Xichen remembers a morning of drinking tea, hearing the disciples break their rules of no gossiping. He remembers how bitter the tea tasted afterwards, how it did not settle in his stomach upon hearing of their deaths. Jiang Cheng was still young, barely in his forties, and Jin Ling even younger. Their deaths were a great shock to the cultivational world.</p>

      <p>The circumstances were even more shocking.</p>

      <p><em>Sect Leader Jiang has been on the verge of a qi deviation for years, </em>they said. <em>He's been obsessed with finding demonic cultivators. He's still angry about the Yiling Patriarch.</em></p>

      <p><em>He's nothing like the man he used to be.</em></p>

      <p><em>A night hunt accident? Doubtful. It had to be qi deviation.</em></p>

      <p><em>Poor Sect Leader Jin... He must have tried to stop his uncle, but it resulted in his death instead. What a tragic turn of events.</em></p>

      <p>With rumours, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. For the sake of respecting their souls, Xichen refused to listen to them any longer. He only prayed that both of them found peace in the afterlife.</p>

      <p>Xichen grips onto the railings. There is no easy way to tell this to Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>In the end, it is Jiang Cheng who speaks first. He lets out a breath of laughter, shaking his head.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúActually...‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDon't tell me.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen fails to hide the surprise, and relief, on his face.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIt doesn't matter. It won't change anything.‚Äù Jiang Cheng answers his unspoken question. ‚ÄúI'm sick of letting the past upset me. No matter who I was back then, it won't change who I am now.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Xichen is almost speechless. He looks at Jiang Cheng as if he expects him to grow a second head. After Jiang Cheng glares at him for his obvious shock, Xichen responds with another smile of his own. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù he says, resisting the urge to laugh at Jiang Cheng's confusion. ‚ÄúYou <em>are</em> different from who you were all those years ago.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng squints at him. ‚ÄúI'll take that as a compliment.‚Äù</p>

      <p>The wind stirs between them once again, bringing forth another silence that hangs in the air. Jiang Cheng gazes back towards his apartment; any hints of the amusement on his face is long gone, replaced by the same sombre expression he had when Xichen walked in here.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWangji will come back with your brother,‚Äù Xichen tells him, not because he wants to reassure Jiang Cheng, but because he knows it's the truth. Wangji will not steal Wei Wuxian away. He is not like that. He has never been like that.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng does not say anything. Xichen breathes out and straightens his legs. ‚ÄúI should go. I will be in my apartment if you‚Äî‚Äù</p>

      <p>A hand grabs onto his elbow. ‚ÄúStay,‚Äù Jiang Cheng says, not quite meeting his eyes. He is looking down at his hand, still holding onto Xichen, before slowly letting go.</p>

      <p>Xichen sees him licking his lips, frowning to himself as if his own actions confuse him. ‚ÄúI don't like being by myself,‚Äù Jiang Cheng admits. ‚ÄúAnd I think you don't like it as well.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Again, there is a cold breeze that brushes them. This time, it no longer sends a shiver up Xichen's spine. He turns back to the view of the balcony, admiring Gusu in all its unchanging splendour. Jiang Cheng is right. Xichen does not like being alone.</p>

      <p>He stays.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="center">- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The first thing he notices is that it is cold. Too cold. He has never felt so cold and <em>heavy</em> in his long life. His limbs are like lead and every breath he takes is a struggle. When he opens his eyes, there is a blurred view in front of him, his body still refusing to let go of sleep.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIt took you long enough to wake up. I was beginning to think you wouldn't survive.‚Äù</p>

      <p>A woman. Who?</p>

      <p>Wangji forces himself awake. He blinks several times, allowing his eyes to adjust to the sudden brightness that assaults them. In front of him is a woman with eyes as black as a void. <em>Baoshan Sanren.</em></p>

      <p>In that instant, everything returns to him. He surges up, staggering as the world beneath him suddenly spins in circles.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúCareful.‚Äù Baoshan Sanren's voice sounds like a whisper among drowning waves. ‚ÄúThe loss of your core is a tremendous shock to your body. It will not be able to survive if you do not give it time to adjust.‚Äù</p>

      <p>He ignores her advice. The room is still spinning, but it slows down enough for Wangji to see that Wei Ying is nowhere to be found. He is no longer on the bed where they laid him. His heart skips a beat, fearing for the worst.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWhere is Wei Ying?‚Äù he asks, turning to the immortal. A million scenarios play in his head. Wei Ying is not alive, and Wangji's sacrifice was for naught. Wei Ying <em>is</em> alive and he had run away, fearing the lack of his memories. Wangji is not sure what scares him more.</p>

      <p>Baoshan Sanren nods towards the door. ‚ÄúHe's outside.‚Äù</p>

      <p>It is amazing how two words can paralyse his entire body. Wangji stares at the small door, its distance more intimidating than he could ever expect.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHe's alive,‚Äù he says, almost in question.</p>

      <p>Baoshan Sanren nods.</p>

      <p><em>It worked,</em> he thinks. He ought to be relieved. Wei Ying is alive, and by the sounds of it, he has stayed.</p>

      <p>Then, why is he suddenly terrified? Wangji can only stare at the door, unable to will himself to take a step forward.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúIs he... Is he well?‚Äù he quietly asks. <em>Has he forgotten about me?</em></p>

      <p>As always, it is as if Baoshan Sanren hears his unspoken question. There is pity in her dark eyes, making it difficult for Wangji to return her gaze.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúPerhaps you should ask him yourself,‚Äù she says. Pretending to be preoccupied with the herbs on her table, she turns away and hums a faint song under her breath. Wangji can barely hear it above the thundering of his pulse.</p>

      <p>He places a hand above where his core is‚Äîor where it <em>used</em> to be. Without it, his whole body is... cold, empty. Hollow. One step forward feels like a dangerous balance that will end with him toppling over the edge.</p>

      <p>Aside from the sudden weakness, everything is the same. He cannot help but think <em>is this all there is? </em>Is this what being mortal is like, after so many years of envying it?</p>

      <p>He pushes aside those thoughts and forces himself to take a step forward. And another. And another.</p>

      <p>The fresh scent of the woods greet him, and the nearby trickle of a river is the first thing he hears when he steps out of the cottage. As soon as he looks forward, everything else fades away and all he focuses on is the person standing in the centre of the forest.</p>

      <p>Although he has his back turned towards him, Wangji would recognise Wei Ying from a mile away.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying does not move, not even when Wangji slowly closes the distance between them, disturbing the silence with loud crunches of branches breaking beneath his feet. He remembers a similar memory from a lifetime ago; watching Wei Ying in the distance, unable to reach him no matter how much he tried.</p>

      <p><em>He's alive</em>, Wangji tells himself again. Wei Ying is alive, and it is enough.</p>

      <p><em>It is enough.</em></p>

      <p>Wangji clenches his fists by his side. ‚ÄúWei Ying,‚Äù he calls out, waiting for him to turn around.</p>

      <p>Seconds pass. Around them, the forest stirs, waiting as well. Wei Ying does not turn around, not for what seems like forever. Wangji remains where he is, unable to ignore the many thoughts that spiral in his head. <em>This is enough, </em>he repeats again and again. <em>Wei Ying is alive. This is enough.</em></p>

      <p>After a gruelling eternity, Wei Ying finally turns around. His eyes narrow at Wangji.</p>

      <p>He looks the same as usual. If it were not for the blood that stained his clothes, Wangji would think that the incident in the casino never occurred.</p>

      <p>Neither of them say anything. Wei Ying continues to stare at him as if he sees a stranger. Wangji does not know what to do. Is he wondering who he is? Is he asking a million questions in his head, one of them questioning if Wangji is safe to be around? It has only occurred to him now that waking up in the middle of the forest, covered in blood, cannot be comforting at all. It is a miracle Wei Ying has not yet run away.</p>

      <p><em>This is enough.</em> As long as Wei Ying is well, then Wangji will be content.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying looks away, frowning at the trees around them.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou waited so long... Why?‚Äù</p>

      <p>For a short moment, everything stops. The forest stills. Wangji stiffens.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying turns back to him. ‚ÄúAll this time, you were alive. It's you; it's always been you.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes widen. Around him, everything moves again. Leaves scatter in the wind as their trees sway to and fro. The rays of the sun paint golden stripes that glitter on the forest floor. Wei Ying stays where he is, watching him, waiting.</p>

      <p>He takes a deep breath, finding it impossible to muster his voice. ‚ÄúYou remember,‚Äù he says.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying flinches. He clutches his head and squeezes his eyes shut. ‚ÄúI do. Everything... It feels like my head is about to split.‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>He remembers. </em>The questions that spring forth are too loud for Wangji to decide what he is feeling. Baoshan Sanren had warned him that Wei Ying would forget everything‚Äîthen why? Why does he remember?</p>

      <p>‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Wangji asks. This must be a cruel dream. He is scared that if he moves, if he speaks too loudly, he will wake up and face reality. This cannot be real.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head. He opens his eyes again, and there is that familiar spark in them that Wangji has missed. ‚ÄúFirst things first, <em>I </em>should ask <em>how</em> I'm still alive. If I remember correctly, I got shot.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Before he can stop himself, Wangji winces. He had not expected Wei Ying to remember at all, therefore he never intended to tell him what he had done.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù Wei Ying slowly asks.</p>

      <p>There is no use in lying to him, nor can he hide the truth. Wei Ying deserves to know. ‚ÄúI sacrificed my core in order to bring you back,‚Äù he quietly says.</p>

      <p>There is no shock on Wei Ying's face. His shoulders drop, as if he has expected it. ‚ÄúJust like in the story,‚Äù he mutters, looking down. ‚ÄúWhy would you do that?‚Äù</p>

      <p><em>Because it was no choice. </em>Because he would have done it again and again, if it meant there was a sliver of a chance that Wei Ying would come back. Because all he had ever wanted was for Wei Ying to be happy, even if that meant he was not in his life.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúDoes it need saying?‚Äù Wangji says.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying raises his head, meeting his gaze. His grey eyes reflect the golden hues of the sun. ‚ÄúI'd like to hear it from you.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji swallows the dry lump in his throat. His chest rises and falls, heavy with the words he wishes to finally, finally say. By habit, his first instinct is to push them back, ignore his feelings because they are just that; <em>his</em> feelings. He has never wanted to burden Wei Ying with them.</p>

      <p>But... now... Now, Wei Ying is waiting. Wangji stares deep into his eyes and forces himself to speak.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll this time, Wei Ying, I have loved you.‚Äù</p>

      <p>As soon as the words are out, Wei Ying sucks in a breath and quickly looks away. Wangji does not miss the sheen over his eyes, the tears that he is now trying to blink back.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúAll those years... centuries. <em>Millennia.</em>‚Äù He wipes his eyes, still refusing to look at Wangji. ‚ÄúYou've been alive all this time. How could you do it?‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI did not want to give up. I thought, perhaps, I would find you eventually.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying smiles. There are still tears that gather by his eyes but he has now stopped trying to wipe them away. ‚ÄúYou did,‚Äù he says, facing him again. ‚ÄúYou found me again.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji's heart stutters. ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù After all these years, Wei Ying is now standing before him, real and <em>alive. </em>The shock is so great that he cannot move from where he is standing, only able to stare at Wei Ying like he is a ghostly apparition.</p>

      <p>For some reason, the smile on Wei Ying's face falters and he averts his eyes down again. There is frown tugging on his eyebrows, almost reluctantly. ‚ÄúAm I even the same person you fell in love with?‚Äù His voice lowers into a whisper. ‚ÄúI... I don't even know myself right now. I don't know which Wei Ying I am. I remember the Sunshot Campaign... I remember A-Yuan and Wen Qing and <em>everyone. </em>I remember dying in the Burial Mounds. I remember our fights.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying holds his head, flinching. ‚ÄúI also remember I'm a teacher. I remember being in high school, letting Huaisang copy my homework. I remember being with you... But none of these memories fit together. If you fell in love with me back then, then am I even the same‚Äî‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji steps forward. He grabs Wei Ying's hands and nearly stiffens at the realisation that, <em>yes</em>, he is real. He is not a ghost. He can touch him and he is real, he is here.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYou <em>are. </em>You have always been the same,‚Äù he insists. ‚ÄúEven if you did not have the same face, I would have known. Even if you were a different man, I would have known.‚Äù It is strange how much easier it is to reveal what he is feeling now that he has exposed himself. Wangji grasps his hands tighter. ‚ÄúAnd I would still feel the same.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyes are wide. Perhaps he is just as shocked as Wangji is that he is able to say these things out loud. Although they were in a relationship before this, Wangji has been careful not to reveal too much to Wei Ying. He did not want to scare him away or accidentally say something that would make him suspicious. He considered himself lucky that he was able to be with Wei Ying, but he always reminded himself that this would not last forever. One day, he would have to leave. Wei Ying would age, and as always, he would not. He would be left behind, forced to watch Wei Ying leave his life again.</p>

      <p>But it did not matter, not yet. He was content. He was happy living in the present. When Wei Ying returned to his life, it felt as if the sands of time had began to fall again. Life continued, no longer paused in monotone.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúBeing with you again... I had forgotten how long I waited,‚Äù Wangji admits. ‚ÄúMeeting you for the second time was worth everything.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying ducks his head down. His hands are shaking underneath Wangji's. ‚ÄúHang on,‚Äù he mutters. ‚ÄúI... I'm letting all this sink in. It's‚ÄîIt's a bit hard when you've just been resurrected and you suddenly have someone confessing their feelings for you.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji hears the hint of a joke in his tone. He smiles. The relief that he <em>can</em> smile after everything that has happened is overwhelming. He revels at the feel of Wei Ying's hands in his own, still wondering if this is all a dream.</p>

      <p>After a while, Wei Ying looks up. He pulls his hands away, running them up and down his arms. ‚ÄúYou love me,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúeven after all the horrible things I did and said to you? Even after I told you to get lost?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji does not need to think about the answer at all. He nods without hesitation.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúAnd you love me now, even when I made you watch all the Shrek movies in a row? Even when I almost killed you and your brother with alcohol?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Laughter comes easy. He breathes out an amused huff, elated at the amusement also playing on Wei Ying's face.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúYes, Wei Ying. I do.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying laughs with him. Rubbing the back of his head, he relaxes into a smile that illuminates the rest of his face.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúI'm still so confused. None of this should be possible,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I... I think I have your answer.‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji frowns. ‚ÄúMy answer?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's smile widens. ‚ÄúYes, Lan Zhan. Ask me again what you used to ask me all the time, back when everyone, including me, was convinced we were sworn enemies.‚Äù</p>

      <p>For a moment, Wangji does not know what he means. He thinks back to those times, when Wei Ying's eyes were the same colour as blood and he had looked at him with disdain. Every time they met, they parted on bad terms, with each meeting more bitter than the last. Wei Ying despised Wangji's concern for his welfare, mistaking it for the same scorn that everyone threw at him‚Äîbut Wangji was not the same as everyone. Wangji cared. He only wished for Wei Ying to be safe.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Wei Ying urges. His eyes are grey, not red, and his lips are parted in anticipation.</p>

      <p>Wangji steps forward, close enough that he can hear the quiet hitch of Wei Ying's breath.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúCome back to Gusu with me,‚Äù he says, repeating the words that used to cause him pain every time he uttered them. He expected nothing whenever he said it out loud, but he prayed, he <em>wished, </em>that by some miracle, Wei Ying would understand one day. <em>One day.</em></p>

      <p>The grin on Wei Ying's face spreads and his eyes shine with unshed tears. He laughs, filling the whole forest with its sound. ‚ÄúDoes that offer still stand?‚Äù</p>

      <p>Wangji takes his hands once again. ‚ÄúForever.‚Äù</p>

      <p>As soon as the word leaves his mouth, Wei Ying lunges at him. Wangji is enveloped in the warm scent of lotus blooms, the wisps of Wei Ying's unkempt hair tickling his cheeks. He buries his face into his neck, memorising everything, <em>anything. </em>Wei Ying is real and alive and he is here. Wangji tightens his arms around him, afraid to let go.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúForever?‚Äù Wei Ying pops his head up and scoffs. ‚ÄúI think you've waited long enough. <em>Yes,</em> Lan Zhan,‚Äù he says, flashing Wangji the most beautiful grin he has ever seen. ‚ÄúLet's go home.‚Äù</p>
