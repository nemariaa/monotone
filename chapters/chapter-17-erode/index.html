      <p>When Wei Ying asked Lan Zhan out on a date, he honestly had innocent intentions. <em>Maybe</em> he was expecting to hold hands like the sap he is, and <em>maybe</em> he was also hoping for a kiss at some point—but still! Completely innocent! Lan Zhan didn't strike him as the sort of person who slept with just about anyone. Then again, Lan Zhan also didn't strike him as the sort of person who would kiss him so hard his knees felt like jelly either.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying barely registers anything aside from the deafening pounding of his heart, louder with each step he takes. Lan Zhan's hand is warm in his grasp; a constant reminder that he is right here—and that's where his thoughts go downhill because Wei Ying will remember how much of a good kisser Lan Zhan is and <em>why the fuck </em>is their hotel so far away?</p>

      <p>He fumbles with the key card to their door, opening it a bit too aggressively and wincing at the loud <em>bang</em> that follows when it collides with the wall. Wei Ying awkwardly steps inside, sighing in relief once he sees there's no damage done. Jin Zixuan can afford to pay for damages if anything happens, but how is Wei Ying going to explain that he was too eager to get inside the room because he wants to continue what Lan Zhan and him started in that park?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying winces at that train of thought. He hears the sound of the door closing behind him; Lan Zhan's soft footsteps get closer and closer.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying.”</p>

      <p>Releasing the breath he's been holding all this time, Wei Ying turns around. It comes out in the form of a nervous laugh as he takes in Lan Zhan's loose hair and the crooked angle of his tie. Lan Zhan steps forward, and that's all the confirmation Wei Ying needs to close the distance between them.</p>

      <p>Like before, their kiss starts out gentle. Lan Zhan cups his cheeks, sliding their lips together so slow that it makes Wei Ying's heart palpitate. It's the sort of thing that catches him off guard; he's used to just rushing onto the bed, taking off his clothes and getting straight to it—but no, Lan Zhan kisses him like he's got all the time in the world and he wants to focus every second of it on this moment.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying likes it. He snakes his arms around Lan Zhan's neck, reaching up to run his hands through his long hair. The soft strands escape his fingers and he hears a low noise coming from the musician. Wei Ying does it again, angling Lan Zhan's head so he can kiss him deeper.</p>

      <p>In time, Lan Zhan's hands trail down, leaving goosebumps in their journey. A shudder escapes Wei Ying as Lan Zhan grips his waist, leaving no space between them. His head is dizzy with nothing but <em>Lan Zhan</em> invading his senses; sandalwood, mint, the hard expanse of his body against Wei Ying's.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying eagerly parts his mouth open, letting out a content hum as their tongues meet. Through the haze, he hears Lan Zhan's breath quicken; he feels him shuddering, his hands gripping Wei Ying's waist even more. Even so, his actions are slow. Hesitant.</p>

      <p><em>He's holding back.</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying pulls away, searching Lan Zhan's face for any sign that he may not want this. There's a brief flash of hurt that squeezes his heart at the thought Lan Zhan doesn't want <em>him,</em> but it's soon squashed away when the older man leans in again, eyes fixed on Wei Ying. He stops before their lips meet, simply because Wei Ying has not moved.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying...” Lan Zhan's voice is barely audible. Wei Ying watches his Adam's apple bob up and down, wondering what words he's swallowing away.</p>

      <p>“It's okay,” Wei Ying reassures. “Don't hold back.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's jaw clenches. He inhales a deep breath and kisses him again. Although it was exactly what he asked for, Wei Ying is surprised by the hard press of Lan Zhan's mouth, immediately parting his lips open and sucking on his tongue. He struggles to catch up and tugs on Lan Zhan's hair. In an instant, a low moan escapes the older man. He pushes Wei Ying back until he's pressing him against the wall and all Wei Ying can do is gasp into his mouth.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying rakes his fingers through Lan Zhan's hair. The only sounds he hears now are the stampede of his pulse and the wet noises of their lips desperately trying to meet each other. His body heats; he wants nothing more than to take his clothes off and go on the <em>bed</em>, but Lan Zhan won't move. He's relentless, not once wanting to part from Wei Ying. He chases his lips again and again, biting and sucking. It's not long until Wei Ying's chest aches and he has to pull away. He rests his head against the wall, gasping for breath.</p>

      <p>A surprised moan drawls out of him as Lan Zhan's lips trail down his jaw. Wei Ying cranes his head, pleased when the other man takes this as a sign to kiss his neck. Lan Zhan sucks on his pulse point; occasionally biting, only to soothe the momentary pain by pressing gentle kisses afterwards. He does this repeatedly until Wei Ying is a dizzy mess and his neck is covered in marks that he <em>knows</em> will stay with him for days.</p>

      <p>He doesn't care. The thought of waking up and seeing all of the marks Lan Zhan has left on him excites him more than it should. Wei Ying impatiently tugs on Lan Zhan's hair again. In the back of his mind, he can feel strong hands running down his thighs; the tips of Lan Zhan's fingers leave him trembling and Wei Ying unconsciously parts his legs—</p>

      <p>“Lan Zhan!” Wei Ying cries, bracing himself as he's literally lifted from the ground. Lan Zhan grabs hold of his legs and crushes him into the wall, capturing his lips once again.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying wouldn't say he's <em>heavy</em> but the way Lan Zhan holds him makes him feel like he weighs nothing at all! The hard surface of the wall behind him digs into his spine, yet Wei Ying welcomes how uncomfortable it is, clawing at Lan Zhan's back. He wraps his legs tighter around him and stiffens at the unmistakable bulge that presses against his groin. <em>Fuck, </em>Wei Ying thinks. <em>Fuck.</em></p>

      <p>Moaning, Wei Ying bucks his hips forward, rewarded by a husky groan that comes from the musician soon after. Wei Ying grins. He does it again and again, until Lan Zhan is doing the same and they're desperately grinding into each other.</p>

      <p><em>Fuck fuck fuck, </em>Wei Ying mentally chants. He throws his head back and loses himself in the rush. He can feel the ache of his own dick straining against his pants but as much as he wants Lan Zhan to just fuck him already, he can't pull away from this. Lan Zhan overtakes him, bucking into him with a ferocity that Wei Ying would have never expected. The back of his head knocks against the wall and he can't even bring himself to complain. All Wei Ying can do is moan and close his eyes, clinging onto Lan Zhan as if his life depends on it. He needs more, <em>fuck—</em>Lan Zhan is driving him <em>insane.</em></p>

      <p>“<em>Bed,” </em>Wei Ying gasps. “B-Bed. Lan Zhan—the <em>bed</em>.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan hefts him up. He travels across the room with no difficulty whatsoever and lays Wei Ying down on the bed. Panting for breath, Wei Ying sinks into the sheets.</p>

      <p>“Lan Zhan... You... You're so...” Wei Ying struggles to find a word to describe him, so all he can do is pull him closer. He spreads his legs as Lan Zhan crawls over him, enveloping all of his senses with the overwhelming scent of sandalwood. His lips are red from all the kissing they've done, and – for once – his hair is a mess—but not in an <em>I-just-woke-up-and-my-life-is-a-mess</em> kind of way, but <em>I'm-about-to-wreck-you-and-you-should-be-begging</em>.</p>

      <p>Well, kind of. Wei Ying isn't the sort to beg (that's a lie; he is) and as hot as Lan Zhan looks right now, he wants to have some <em>fun</em> first. Lan Zhan is so stiff and proper all the time, surely there's a limit to that?</p>

      <p>Running his hands over Lan Zhan's chest, Wei Ying smiles at the evident hunger in his eyes. He deliberately takes his time to stroke his tie, tugging on it ever so slightly. As usual, Lan Zhan is as stiff as a lamppost; all hard muscle and self control. Wei Ying makes a show of pouting, even going as far as to look at Lan Zhan from beneath his eyelashes. The only indication he gets that it's working is when Lan Zhan's golden eyes narrow and his Adam's apple bobs up and down again. It takes all of Wei Ying's mental strength not to burst out laughing.</p>

      <p>“Mr. Lan, aren't you hot in this suit?” Wei Ying asks. He yanks on the tie—harder this time—and brings Lan Zhan down till he can brush their lips together. “I think we should take it off.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan shudders. Within seconds, he's pulling his blazer off and Wei Ying is grinning as he loosens Lan Zhan's tie, helping him. He throws that onto the floor and makes quick work of unbuttoning Lan Zhan's shirt, running his hands over the hard planes of muscle under.</p>

      <p>“Isn't that better?” Wei Ying teases, slipping Lan Zhan's shirt off his shoulders. He can't resist leaning back and admiring the sight of the man looming over him.</p>

      <p>His gaze falls on the circular brand on his chest. It's impossible to ignore and the obvious question almost rolls off his tongue. Wei Ying bites it back, not wanting to interrupt the moment. Questions can wait.</p>

      <p>Instead, he pushes himself up on his elbows and trails his lips over the uneven ridges of the scar. Lan Zhan stiffens; a choked breath escapes him as Wei Ying darts his tongue out, licking along the edge of his brand.</p>

      <p>“<em>Wei Ying,” </em>Lan Zhan hisses. He grasps Wei Ying's shoulders.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying stops, waiting for him to push him off. When Lan Zhan doesn't, he slowly continues what he started, kissing each ridge of the sun-like brand on his chest. He's never bothered to pay this much attention to someone else's body before. If this was anyone else, Wei Ying's clothes would be off and they'd have already started fucking.</p>

      <p>It's not that he doesn't want Lan Zhan inside him already, because he does, <em>fuck,</em> he really does; it's just that with Lan Zhan here in all his glory, it's impossible not to take a moment and appreciate how good he looks. Wei Ying is starting to enjoy the subtle changes in his breathing whenever he teases him. Lan Zhan is usually so mysterious and hard to read; the fact that Wei Ying can have this effect on him makes him smug and happy. Strangely happy.</p>

      <p>His mouth travels up Lan Zhan's collarbone, sucking on the crook of his neck. He leaves a mark, similar to the ones that now cover his own. Pleased, Wei Ying pulls back and smiles up at the older man. He notices the obvious flush in his ears, such a stark contrast to the white jade of his skin.</p>

      <p><em>How cute</em>.</p>

      <p>That thought soon leaves him as Lan Zhan crushes him back into the bed. Wei Ying grins. He reaches down and presses the hard length straining Lan Zhan's pants. As he expected, and hoped, Lan Zhan chokes out in surprise. His eyes narrow again.</p>

      <p>A shiver runs up Wei Ying's spine. Lan Zhan's eyes are cold and hazy, and his expression is enough to tell him that he'll regret it if he keeps teasing him like this.</p>

      <p>Which is exactly what Wei Ying wants.</p>

      <p>He chews on his bottom lip, looking up at Lan Zhan with feigned innocence.</p>

      <p>“Why are you glaring at me, Lan Zhan?” Wei Ying whispers. He lightly pats the hem of Lan Zhan's trousers, resisting the urge to start grinning again. Lan Zhan is practically frozen, but that doesn't stop Wei Ying. In fact, it spurs him on.</p>

      <p>“I know you like this,” Wei Ying continues. “Didn't I tell you not to hold back?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's jaw clenches. Before he can say anything, Wei Ying slips his hand into his pants and grasps him.</p>

      <p>“<em>Wei Ying!”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying can't hide the surprise in his eyes. Lan Zhan feels <em>much</em> bigger than he expected. He pumps the hard length, trying to gauge how big he is exactly before his pants come off. He's barely able to wrap his whole hand around him, that's for sure. Wei Ying takes his time to stroke him from the tip to the base, up and down, up and down, listening to every struggling breath Lan Zhan takes. The large dick twitches in his hands and Wei Ying himself starts to find it harder to <em>think</em> when he imagines this will be inside him soon. He bites his lip, squeezing his palm around the length ever so slightly.</p>

      <p>“Wei Ying... <em>You...</em>” Lan Zhan shudders as Wei Ying presses his thumb against the slit of his dick. He takes several breaths through his nose, shaking. <em>“Enough.”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying widens his eyes, slowly rubbing his thumb over the engorged head. “You don't like this?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan closes his eyes, gripping his arm tight. “You are teasing me.”</p>

      <p>“<em>I know,” </em>Wei Ying grins. “I like your angry face, Lan Zhan.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan doesn't say anything but the noise he lets out almost sounds like a fucking <em>growl.</em></p>

      <p><em>Okay. Shit. That's kinda hot. </em>Wei Ying swallows down the lump in his throat and loosens his hand. <em>I'm going to die.</em></p>

      <p>He's wasted enough time. Leaning into Lan Zhan's ear, Wei Ying whispers: “There's lube in my suitcase. The big pocket by the side.”</p>

      <p>He pulls out his hand, fixing Lan Zhan's pants for him. A laugh nearly escapes him as he watches Lan Zhan leave the bed to find the infamous bottle of lube in the blink of an eye. Wei Ying ignores Wen Qing's smug face appearing in his head, already gloating that she was right all along. Actually, imagining your best friend while you're about to get dicked down isn't normal once he thinks about it. Wei Ying vehemently shakes his head, pushing her out his thoughts.</p>

      <p>He busies himself by slipping off his jacket, chucking it into a far corner of the room. His sweatshirt follows shortly after. Before he can start working on his trousers, Lan Zhan returns with the bottle of lube in his hands.</p>

      <p>“Don't ask why I have lube with me,” Wei Ying quickly says. “I swear I wasn't planning on having sex with you—not that I don't want to have sex with you because you're really hot and everything but I didn't know if you wanted—”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan shuts him up with another kiss.</p>

      <p>From then on, everything is a rush. They fumble to take off each other's pants, unwilling to break off from their kiss. At some point, Wei Ying whines and impatiently shakes off his pants himself while Lan Zhan does the same (minus the whining). Every time they part, they meet for another kiss, and another. Wei Ying is greedy and wants to keep Lan Zhan all to himself, messing up his hair as he shuffles his bottom so his boxers can be pulled off. He shudders at the feeling of Lan Zhan's naked body pressing against his own, eyes snapping open at the realisation this is <em>actually </em>happening.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying groans, bucking his hips forward, chasing the sensation of their dicks rubbing with each other. Now that his eyes are open, he's left breathless at the sight of Lan Zhan before him. He was already perfect before but, <em>wow, </em>he's unreal without clothes on. How is it possible for one man to look <em>so</em> good?</p>

      <p>He can't be human. He looks more like a marble statue—except <em>better</em> than a marble statue. Wei Ying's been in a lot of museums; those statues have nothing on Lan Zhan. For starters, those statues have tiny dicks! Lan Zhan's dick is definitely not tiny at all!</p>

      <p>Wei Ying's eyes shamelessly trail down, staring at the impressive length. He's seen a lot of dicks in the past; over time, they all end up looking the same to him. Maybe it's because he hasn't had sex in <em>ages</em> that he finds he's getting excited now, more than he remembers he ever has been when it comes to sex. Come to think of it, has he <em>ever</em> had sex completely sober?</p>

      <p>Once he stops staring at Lan Zhan's dick, Wei Ying realises he's not the only one taking this opportunity to admire the person in front of them. He blushes at the intensity in Lan Zhan's gaze, resisting the urge to cover himself. Why is he even getting shy all of a sudden?</p>

      <p>“Don't look at me like that,” he mutters, forcing out a half hearted chuckle.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan moves closer. His long hair brushes Wei Ying's stomach; it tickles, making him squirm.</p>

      <p>“Why?” Lan Zhan asks. “You are beautiful.”</p>

      <p>The urge to cover his face is ridiculously strong. For the sake of his own pride, Wei Ying lightly smacks Lan Zhan on the shoulder instead.</p>

      <p>“<em>Ahh, </em>Lan Zhan. You certainly know how to flatter my ego.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan ducks down and presses a kiss on his lips. It lasts one second, but Wei Ying's heart still stops. “It's the truth,” he says.</p>

      <p>When he says it like that... Wei Ying bites his bottom lip in a vain effort to hide his smile. Lan Zhan really is unlike any person he's met before...</p>

      <p>“Touch me,” Wei Ying says. “I want you, Lan Zhan.”</p>

      <p>His eyes flutter close as Lan Zhan presses kisses down his collarbone and chest. All the while, his hands grip Wei Ying's thighs, keeping them parted. Lan Zhan is too slow, nothing like the <em>need</em> Wei Ying has right now. He wants to beg him to hurry up and take him already, though Wei Ying will be lying if he said he didn't like the attention. An impatient whine drawls out of him as he feels Lan Zhan's breath hovering above one of his nipples, fingers lightly brushing Wei Ying's dick.</p>

      <p>“<em>Lan Zhan,” </em>Wei Ying moans, tugging on Lan Zhan's hair. When Lan Zhan finally closes his lips around Wei Ying's nipple, Wei Ying involuntarily arches his back, begging for more.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan <em>still</em> isn't touching him down there. Wei Ying thinks he might go insane, with only the feeling of Lan Zhan's tongue and teeth. In time, he sucks harder, alternating between each nipple, ignoring Wei Ying's obvious attempt in grinding against him. One of Lan Zhan's hands holds his waist, surprisingly strong enough to pin him down despite Wei Ying's struggles<em>. </em>Why is he being so slow? Does he want Wei Ying to literally beg him?</p>

      <p>“<em>Lan Zhan!” </em>Wei Ying all but cries. “Please touch me properly! You're not being fair!”</p>

      <p>He stiffens at the feel of Lan Zhan suddenly grasping his bottom. Before it dawns on him what he's doing, a finger grazes along the rim of his hole. Wei Ying holds his breath and spreads his legs wider, letting out a hiss of pleasure as finally, <em>finally, </em>the finger sinks inside him, already slick with lube.</p>

      <p>“Oh, <em>yes.</em>” Wei Ying jerks his hips forward. “<em>Ah, ah... </em>Lan Zhan, <em>yes...</em>”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's fingers are longer than his. Wei Ying is used to fingering himself whenever he feels like masturbating, but it's not the <em>same. </em>He's dizzy with need and this rush making his head spin isn't helping; it amplifies the pleasure surging through him. <em>More, </em>he thinks. <em>More. </em>Slowly, Lan Zhan strokes the insides of his walls, pushing his finger in and out, in and out. It feels good but it's not <em>enough.</em></p>

      <p>“Y-You can... You can add another finger in—please,” Wei Ying begs. “And f-faster! Please, Lan Zhan! Stop teasing!”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying might cry from frustration at this rate. He gasps at the stretch of the second finger, twisting its way inside him until Lan Zhan is knuckle deep. Once Wei Ying begins to whine again, Lan Zhan sets a steady pace. He pulls out, then back in, digging his fingers deeper than the last. In time, Wei Ying meets his thrusts and moans louder as Lan Zhan's pace increases, sometimes arching his fingers against the spot that makes him want to scream.</p>

      <p>“<em>Fuck,” </em>Wei Ying gasps out. He's practically bouncing on Lan Zhan's hand at this rate, unable to stop himself. If this carries on, he'll come too soon.</p>

      <p>All of a sudden, Lan Zhan lifts his hips off the bed. Wei Ying's eyes open wide, just in time to feel Lan Zhan's fingers driving deeper inside him. He cries, squirming as a third finger is squeezed past his rim. <em>Shit. </em>Lan Zhan relentlessly drives his fingers into the same spot, forcing choked moans out of Wei Ying until he no longer has the strength to keep meeting his thrusts. The pleasure in his stomach pools dangerously, his dick aching.</p>

      <p>“<em>God,</em> Lan Zhan! Y-You're—!” Wei Ying shakily tries to grab Lan Zhan's arm. The fingers pound against his prostate again and he throws his head back, trembling. “Not yet! Stop! <em>Please!</em>”</p>

      <p>Too soon, Lan Zhan stops. He pulls his fingers out of Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>“Not good?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying licks his lips, panting. He looks up at Lan Zhan, spotting the concern in his golden eyes. <em>Seriously? </em>He has the audacity to think he <em>isn't </em>good after almost making Wei Ying come from his fingers alone? Wei Ying isn't sure whether to cry or laugh.</p>

      <p>“No, no...” Wei Ying says, his voice still shaking. “<em>Too</em> good. I want you <em>now. </em>Please, Lan Zhan. I want you so much.”</p>

      <p>By this point, Wei Ying's thoughts are too hazy with need to think properly. He shivers at the hands gripping his hips tighter and spreads his legs for Lan Zhan to position himself.</p>

      <p>He fumbles to find the bottle of lube, squirting out a few drops into his shaking hands. He quickly strokes Lan Zhan's hard dick and impatiently coats it in lube, rubbing it along his hole. Lan Zhan pushes his hands away, pressing against him so there's no longer any space between their bodies. Another whine escapes Wei Ying, thinking that Lan Zhan is teasing him <em>again.</em></p>

      <p>His complaints die on his tongue as he feels the tip of Lan Zhan's dick slowly entering him. <em>Fuck, finally. </em>Wei Ying clings around Lan Zhan's neck and moans into his ear, spreading his legs as wide as he can. With every inch Lan Zhan sinks into him, Wei Ying loses any ability to function.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan stretches him full; when Wei Ying thinks <em>this is enough</em>, he pushes more, <em>more</em> inside. Groaning, Wei Ying clenches around him, thankful for once that Lan Zhan isn't rushing. It's been a while since he's bothered touching or playing with himself, and a much, <em>much</em> longer time since he's had sex. The burning stretch is uncomfortable, but certainly not unwelcome. Wei Ying takes a few moments to accommodate himself to Lan Zhan's size, leaning in to lick at his lips.</p>

      <p>He only notices now that Lan Zhan is shaking.</p>

      <p>“Wei... <em>Wei Ying,</em>” he hisses out. He still hasn't moved; most likely waiting for Wei Ying to confirm he's okay.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shuffles his bottom slightly, testing himself. He stifles a moan. <em>“Shit.”</em></p>

      <p>Lan Zhan frowns. “Are you okay?”</p>

      <p>“I'm okay. It's... It's been a while.”</p>

      <p>For some reason, something shifts in Lan Zhan's eyes; they narrow and his jaw clenches. The grip he has on Wei Ying's hips tightens, his fingers digging into his skin. It's gone in a blink of an eye, and so is the question that plays on Wei Ying's tongue. Lan Zhan pulls out, slow and torturous, and snaps his hips forward.</p>

      <p>“Lan Zhan!” Wei Ying cries.</p>

      <p>All thoughts abandon him as Lan Zhan barely gives him time to catch up. He eases out, then pounds back into Wei Ying with a force that leaves him breathless. Each thrust rips a moan out of Wei Ying; he desperately tries to meet Lan Zhan's pace but he's never fast enough, only able to whine at the pooling pleasure in his gut. Lan Zhan is deliciously <em>deep</em> inside him and with each second that passes, Wei Ying has to stop himself from going over the edge too soon.</p>

      <p>“<em>Hng! Lan... Lan Zhan!” </em>Wei Ying pulls back, catching Lan Zhan's gaze. All he hears from the older man are low grunts, the occasional hitch of his breath.</p>

      <p>As their eyes meet, Lan Zhan leans in and brushes their noses together, pressing his forehead against his. There's something intimate in the way he looks at him. Wei Ying's heart stutters and he doesn't hesitate to cup Lan Zhan's face. They kiss, and Lan Zhan's pace slows down; he rolls his hips, grinding into the spot that makes Wei Ying see stars. He moans loud into Lan Zhan's mouth, digging his heels against his back in a desperate attempt to get him deeper.</p>

      <p>With a gasp, Wei Ying pulls away. He looks into Lan Zhan's eyes and shudders.</p>

      <p>“Faster,” he pants. “I need you to go faster. <em>Fuck me,</em> Lan Zhan.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan says nothing. He sits up, his burning gaze refusing to leave Wei Ying. From beneath, the sight of Lan Zhan looming over him is almost too much for Wei Ying to stand. He's still buried inside him, his dick twitching but not moving. Wei Ying steadies his breathing, watching as Lan Zhan grabs hold of his thighs.</p>

      <p>Before he knows it, Lan Zhan roughly pulls him down, hooking one of his legs over his shoulder. Wei Ying grips the sheets in surprise, and that's really all he can do as Lan Zhan eases out completely and slams back into him.</p>

      <p>“<em>Ah! L-Lan Zhan! </em>Lan Zhan!” Wei Ying squeezes his eyes tight, stiffening at the slight change of angle. “Lan Zhan! S-So deep!”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan doesn't stop now. He fucks Wei Ying as fast as was asked of him, keeping a tight grip on his hips. With his leg over Lan Zhan's shoulders, the angle he's fucked at is much better, making his toes curl at the overpowering jolts of pleasure.</p>

      <p>The moans that spill out of Wei Ying's lips are loud and long, almost drowning out the sounds of Lan Zhan's thighs hitting against his ass. Frantic with pleasure, Wei Ying starts babbling out anything, <em>everything</em> that can get him to feel better than he already does. He chants Lan Zhan's name, loud enough that he's sure the whole hotel floor knows who is fucking him right now. <em>Let them know, </em>Wei Ying thinks, screaming louder.</p>

      <p>“Don't... Don't hold back! <em>Lan Zhan! </em>Fuck! Please, please—fuck me! Har... Harder! <em>Yes! Yes, yes, </em>yes! <em>Lan Zhan!</em>”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan hoists Wei Ying's hips off the bed. He lifts and drops Wei Ying to meet his thrusts, moving him with ease as if he's nothing but a doll. Limp and incoherent, Wei Ying is all too happy to let him have his way with him. He arches his back, trying so, <em>so</em> hard to keep himself together because he never wants this to end.</p>

      <p>“Oh fuck<em>, </em>oh fuck, oh <em>fuck</em>... Yes, fuck! T-That feels good!” Wei Ying sobs. “It feels so good, Lan Zhan! <em>Ah, </em>don't stop! Please don't stop! Right there! <em>Right there!”</em></p>

      <p>He gets what he asks for. Not once is there a pause; Lan Zhan continues to slam into him, each one as fast, as deep, as <em>hard</em> as the other. His fingers dig into Wei Ying's hips in a way that merges the pleasure with a stinging ache, but Wei Ying welcomes everything and asks for more. <em>Always more.</em> <em>Fuck, </em>he can't get enough. He doesn't think he's ever screamed or moaned for anyone so much in his life; he doesn't know if it's because he hasn't had sex in years or Lan Zhan is just this good—but <em>fuck. </em>Wei Ying is more than happy to think it's the latter option; the way Lan Zhan slams back into him each time pulls him closer and closer the edge. His own dick strains against his stomach, aching for release. He nearly reaches over to stroke himself, but he knows he'll come straight away if he does. <em>Not yet.</em> He wants <em>more.</em></p>

      <p>Desperate, Wei Ying hooks his other leg over Lan Zhan's shoulder. The next thrust almost has his body folded in half and the way Lan Zhan slams <em>straight</em> into his prostate makes his world tremble.</p>

      <p>“<em>Fuck!” </em>Wei Ying screams. “Harder! Right there, Lan Zhan, <em>right there! </em>Harder, please! Faster! <em>Don't stop!</em>”</p>

      <p>A husky grunt is all he hears. Lan Zhan's arms raise up on either side of his head, driving his hips forward so suddenly that the bed rocks with him. Wei Ying jolts—<em>shit. </em>He has no time to gather his senses before Lan Zhan's pace increases even more, relentlessly pounding into him with a strength that leaves his bones shaking. </p>

      <p><em>What the fuck, </em>is all Wei Ying can make out of his thoughts. <em>What the fuck. </em>Every time Lan Zhan pistons back into him, the breath is knocked out of Wei Ying's lungs and part of him fears his bones are literally going to break. It verges on being <em>too</em> hard and <em>too</em> deep; Wei Ying's moans are twinged with a surprised cry of pain—followed by the shaky realisation that he <em>likes</em> this. It's all too much. Unable to keep up, Wei Ying can only cling onto Lan Zhan's shoulders. The bed continuously hammers against the wall, in tune to the sound of Wei Ying's delirious cries.</p>

      <p>“<em>Ah, yes! Yes! Lan Zhan! </em>You're so good! You feel so good, Lan Zhan! Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan... <em>Lan Zhan!</em>” Wei Ying digs his fingernails into Lan Zhan's back. He's so close. <em>So close!</em> “I can't... I can't anymore...! You're... You're driving me—insane! Fuck—<em>fuck!</em> So... So close! <em>I can't!</em>”</p>

      <p>One, two, three thrusts are all it takes for Wei Ying to snap. His body tenses and he throws his head back, the only noises coming out of him are garbled nonsense that imitate Lan Zhan's name. His body spasms and his eyes roll back as he spills all over his stomach. The warm feeling of cum splattering all over him is nothing compared to the overwhelming pleasure that empties his mind. He can feel Lan Zhan's pace becoming unsteady and yet he fucks Wei Ying through his orgasm, reducing him into nothing but weak whimpers.</p>

      <p>With barely any strength left, Wei Ying's legs slip from Lan Zhan's shoulders. He's left in a state of bliss, aware of the hard dick buried deep inside him. Lan Zhan still hasn't come, but from the way his thrusts are now erratic and shallow, Wei Ying gathers it's not long until he will. Weakly, Wei Ying peppers kisses all over his face; his cheeks, the corner of his mouth, his forehead. Lan Zhan shudders and captures his lips, kissing him as he chases his own climax.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying winces at the stinging pleasure that now drag through his sensitive walls. He whimpers and hears Lan Zhan moaning into their kiss, slamming into him one last time. Drained out of all the energy in him, he squirms at the feeling of Lan Zhan's dick twitching as he releases inside. Unconsciously, Wei Ying clenches around him, groaning at the feeling of being filled. It's too late to consider that they probably should have used a condom... Then again, he doubts Wen Qing packed those as well.</p>

      <p>They kiss, both struggling to breathe. The kiss is slow and barely a kiss at all, but Wei Ying is content to stay in Lan Zhan's arms with the feel of his limp dick still buried inside him. He brushes aside the sweat-dampened locks from Lan Zhan's face, smiling when the older man finally opens his eyes.</p>

      <p>“What the fuck, Lan Zhan...” Wei Ying mumbles. “You really surprise me every time.”</p>

      <p>Almost immediately, Lan Zhan's eyebrows furrow and he leans back. Wei Ying has to cling onto him to stop him from pulling out.</p>

      <p>“Are you... okay?” he asks, voice laced with worry.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying chuckles. “Let me catch my breath.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan looks away. The corners of his lips twitch slightly, turning down.</p>

      <p>“Don't look like that,” Wei Ying tells him. He cups Lan Zhan's cheeks and directs him to look back at him. “I liked it.”</p>

      <p>“You did?”</p>

      <p>“<em>Yes.</em> Wasn't I loud enough for you?”</p>

      <p>The tips of Lan Zhan's ears instantly turn a shade of red. Wei Ying laughs harder, pulling Lan Zhan into another kiss.</p>

      <p>“You're so cute, Lan Zhan,” he says, then gets inspired to tease him more. “<em>Lan Er-gege.”</em></p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's eyes widen a fraction.</p>

      <p>“Ooh, you like that? <em>Lan Er-gege?</em>”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan presses his lips together. “Silence.”</p>

      <p>“But you like it! Lan Er-Gege! I'll call you that from now on! Lan Er—”</p>

      <p>His jeers are cut off as Lan Zhan shuts him up with another kiss. Laughing, Wei Ying is only too happy to reciprocate it. He's not sure how long they spend there just kissing; Wei Ying wouldn't mind if they stayed like this all night. Despite the cum all over his stomach and the slight ache in his bones, he's one hundred percent all in favour of keeping Lan Zhan like this.</p>

      <p>Sadly, Lan Zhan doesn't have the same thought process as him. He's the first to pull away, glancing down at Wei Ying's stomach.</p>

      <p>“I will clean you,” he says.</p>

      <p>“Hmm, such a gentleman as always... But, you know, I won't mind it if you stay inside me. In fact, I want you to.” With that, Wei Ying clenches around him, winking when Lan Zhan ears flush yet again.</p>

      <p>“<em>Shameless.”</em></p>

      <p>Wei Ying whines as Lan Zhan pulls out but does nothing to stop him from going to the bathroom. At the very least, he can admire Lan Zhan's ass from this view. What a very nice ass it certainly is.</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan returns with some tissue and a warm, damp towel. He gets rid off all of the cum with the tissue, handling Wei Ying with care like he's supposed to be glass and Lan Zhan didn't just wreck him five minutes ago. After he's done, he uses the damp towel to wipe Wei Ying's stomach and face; the warmth is soothing to the touch and Wei Ying sighs in satisfaction.</p>

      <p>“Good sex <em>and</em> aftercare? Lan Zhan, you're spoiling me,” Wei Ying says, cuddling next to Lan Zhan once they both settle under the blankets.</p>

      <p>As usual, Lan Zhan doesn't say anything; the small smile playing on his lips is enough. They lay like that, with Wei Ying slotted beside Lan Zhan, their legs tangled with each other's. Wei Ying strokes his long hair, playing with the soft locks. He's tired beyond belief and he knows he'll feel the ache tomorrow, though Wei Ying doesn't want to sleep yet. He's too content like this. Too happy.</p>

      <p>He's never felt anything like this before, especially <em>after</em> sex. His experiences were always a rush; nothing more than just a need to chase pleasure. After that's done, Wei Ying will stare into space, filled with nothing but self hatred and shame. He'd stumble back home and fall asleep asking himself why he's let some stranger have their way with him.</p>

      <p>This is the first time he's ever wanted to stay with someone. It doesn't feel wrong to cuddle up to Lan Zhan, stroking his bare arms and smiling when Lan Zhan does the same.</p>

      <p>“Tell me more about yourself,” Wei Ying finds himself saying. “I feel like I've known you forever but... but I don't. I want to know more about you, Lan Zhan.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan raises his eyebrows. “Myself?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, anything! As in... what were you like as a child? I bet you were cute.”</p>

      <p>“That was a long time ago.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying smirks. “You're not <em>that</em> old.”</p>

      <p>“Hm.” There's a slight hint of amusement that dances in Lan Zhan's eyes. It disappears in less than a second, but it was still there. Wei Ying likes to think he's getting good at reading the silent man.</p>

      <p>“I was... quiet,” Lan Zhan says.</p>

      <p>“You're still quiet...”</p>

      <p>“Does it bother you?</p>

      <p>“Me? Nah. You're fine the way you are,” Wei Ying says, rewarded by another smile from Lan Zhan. “So, you were a quiet child. What did you like to do?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan stares off into the distance, as if thinking. Waiting for him, Wei Ying busies himself by braiding a lock of Lan Zhan's hair. He revels at how soft the strands feel between his fingers, although it does make him wonder why Lan Zhan decides to keep his hair long. He'd probably be just as hot with short hair.</p>

      <p>“Spending time with my mother,” Lan Zhan says after a while.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying looks up, not expecting that answer. “What was she like?”</p>

      <p>Something softens in Lan Zhan's face. “She was loud, like you. She teased me a lot.”</p>

      <p>Grinning Wei Ying pokes Lan Zhan's cheeks. “You're <em>fun</em> to tease!”</p>

      <p>He imagines a cute little Lan Zhan sitting on his mother's lap, pouting slightly whenever she teases him. The image is too adorable; Wei Ying doesn't hesitate to poke Lan Zhan's cheeks again.</p>

      <p>“Hm,” Lan Zhan nonchalantly says. “She liked the stars a lot. She wished to know their stories.”</p>

      <p>“Stories?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan nods. “She believed every star had a story.”</p>

      <p>“Did she ever tell you any of them?”</p>

      <p>Shaking his head, Lan Zhan looks down. “She did not know any. She... yearned to explore the world and find stories, but she could not.”</p>

      <p>The urge to ask what he means by that is strong, although Wei Ying does not miss the sudden change in Lan Zhan's tone. His voice is quieter, almost a whisper now. If his mother wished to explore the world but she couldn't, then did that mean she was too ill? She passed away when Lan Zhan was only young?</p>

      <p>Wei Ying doesn't want to ask. He keeps quiet, for once.</p>

      <p>It's Lan Zhan that continues to speak. “She told Brother and I to find them ourselves. For her.”</p>

      <p>“Did you?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan shakes his head again. He falls silent, and Wei Ying is left to his own thoughts.</p>

      <p>His memories of his real parents are very few. As the years passed, time has robbed him of even the image of their faces. If he imagines them, he can only picture unclear faces smiling at him, urging him to go to sleep. The only clear memories he has are the stories they used to tell him every night.</p>

      <p>“My mom used to tell me a lot of stories,” Wei Ying says. “She was brought up by this lady who would tell her all these myths and legends. Mom loved them so much that she travelled the world with Dad, just so her life would be as exciting.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's arms tighten around him, listening as always. Wei Ying lays his head against his shoulder and roots through his head for any remnants of his family. When he thinks of his parents, he can only think of his bedroom; Mom and Dad sitting either side of him, taking turns to share stories that left Wei Ying starry eyed. Dad liked to share tales of their travels, while Mom told him all sorts of myths. She was a dreamer, her head stuck in a world unlike reality.</p>

      <p>“She told me so many...” Wei Ying mumbles. “I remember one of them was about this immortal woman who fell in love with a human.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's head turns to him.</p>

      <p>“Do you wanna hear?”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan nods.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying takes a deep breath. How did that story go again...? It was one of his mother's favourite ones to tell; she'd always share it whenever they looked up at the sky and found there were barely any stars visible.</p>

      <p>“So, there was this immortal woman whose eyes were as black as night,” Wei Ying starts. “Her skin was as pale as the moon; and whenever she spoke, it sounded as if all of the stars in the universe were talking to you. She was very beautiful, but all of the humans feared her.”</p>

      <p>He knows full well that he's no storyteller like his mother. He can't weave the right words like she does, spinning it into a tale that rivals any novel out there. Nevertheless, Lan Zhan remains silent, waiting for him to carry on.</p>

      <p>“One night, a human farmer stumbled upon her while he was in the forest gathering fruits. Unlike any of the other humans she came across, this farmer didn't shy away from her; they talked until the night turned into day and the immortal had to go. For the next few months, they met up in the same forest, talking until the sun returned and they had to part.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying sighs. “Anyway, it wasn't long until they both fell in love. The immortal was so blinded with love that she left the heavens to stay by this man's side. They lived together for years, ignoring the fact that one of them was ageing and the other wasn't. The human never cared that she was an immortal and he wasn't; it was enough for him that he could be with her.”</p>

      <p>Beside him, Lan Zhan stiffens. He says nothing, although Wei Ying catches sight of his jaw clenching. Is he that invested in the story?</p>

      <p>“<em>But </em>in the end, the human fell ill and slowly began to die,” Wei Ying says.</p>

      <p>“What did the immortal do?” Lan Zhan asks. Wei Ying almost doesn't hear him because his voice is so quiet.</p>

      <p>“Everything. But no matter how much the immortal tried to help him, it was no use. He died.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan breathes out. Wei Ying can't help but think it comes out shaky. Is he that affected? Wei Ying didn't think Lan Zhan as the type to get emotional during stories.</p>

      <p>“Unable to face eternal life of being alone, she offered her own heart to him; thinking her magic would resurrect the human back to life.”</p>

      <p>“Her... heart?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying nods, waving a hand. “Yeah. Her heart. Or the source of all her magic. Whatever.”</p>

      <p>“Did it work?”</p>

      <p>“It did—but the human didn't remember her at all. He was resurrected but it was like he was a completely new person. A blank slate.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan's fists clench. Wei Ying spares a moment to pat his hands, loosening them enough so he can entwine their fingers together.</p>

      <p>“For many years, she tried to make him remember, telling him about all of the nights they spent together. She neglected her health and didn't eat or sleep. It never occurred to her that, by giving away the source of her magic, it meant she was no longer immortal either.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan frowns. “She was no longer immortal?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, because she gave her heart away, remember? That was the source of her immortality.”</p>

      <p>“But... the human? Did he turn immortal?”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying shakes his head. “Nah, I don't think so. I think her heart only brought him back to life, but that was it. I don't know—don't ask me.”</p>

      <p>He lets out a chuckle, squeezing Lan Zhan's hand. “<em>Anyway, </em>where was I? Years passed and, still, she didn't give up. Her mortal body grew weaker by the day and the human only continued to think of her as a stranger.”</p>

      <p>“She died,” Lan Zhan says, as a matter of fact.</p>

      <p>“How very blunt, Mr. Lan. But <em>yes</em>, she did. The human found her dead body during the night, when the sky was empty and devoid of stars—except for one.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying points up at the ceiling. This story isn't as effective compared to being outdoors looking up at the stars, but Lan Zhan will have to make do with his improvisation.</p>

      <p>“The human looked up at the star and was reminded of her; of how she stayed by his side every day and how she never gave up. The star was so bright and beautiful that he wanted to name it after her, but even after all this time, he couldn't remember her real name.”</p>

      <p>He lets his arm fall back on the bed, craning his head to look at Lan Zhan. “So, if you ever look up at the sky and see one lone star; that's her. The Nameless Star. A bright star among the darkness, yearning to be remembered.”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan is too busy staring off into the opposite wall. His jaw is clenched and the grip he has on Wei Ying's hand is too tight.</p>

      <p>“Kinda depressing... I should have probably picked a happier story, sorry,” Wei Ying quickly says. Nothing better than a depressing story after sex... Why couldn't he have told the story about the flying unicorns?</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan turns back to him. His hand loosens, shaking his head slightly.</p>

      <p>“No. It is a good story,” he says.</p>

      <p>“At least that's one for you.”</p>

      <p>“...Yes. Mother would have liked to hear it.”</p>

      <p>Wei Ying beams at him. “I'm glad I told you then. If you want to know more, just tell me. Mom and Dad told me so many of them...”</p>

      <p>Lan Zhan pulls him closer, leaning down to kiss his forehead. “Hm. Another time then.”</p>

      <p>Silence settles between them. They stop talking and it's not long until Wei Ying's eyelids begin to droop close. Everything catches up with him; the aching of his limbs, the overwhelming peace he feels with Lan Zhan, this strange happiness he doesn't want to end.</p>

      <p>Nestled in Lan Zhan's arms, Wei Ying falls asleep to the sound of his heartbeat, dreaming of starless skies, of other lifetimes where immortals exist and his parents' faces are as clear as their love for each other. He dreams of golden eyes and white robes, of a voice that sings him the same song every night. The dreams have no pattern and he travels across various years and various lives, wondering if any of this will ever make sense.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>- x -</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Wangji remains awake. Wei Ying's story repeats in his mind, ridding him of any ability to keep his eyes off the slumbering man curled against him. He strokes his fingers through Wei Ying's short hair in a vain attempt to calm his anxiety, but the thought of losing him plays again and again, in different scenarios, different ages, different lifetimes. No matter how and when he loses Wei Ying, it will all be the same.</p>

      <p>He had allowed himself to get lost in this momentary happiness. He is lucky enough that Wei Ying welcomes his presence now. Is it not enough that he has been given the chance to be with Wei Ying? To kiss and love him, as he has always yearned to do so? Is this not enough?</p>

      <p>Wangji hates the voice inside his head that screams <em>no. No, it is not enough.</em></p>

      <p>Nowhere near enough.</p>

      <p>Wei Ying continues to sleep, unaware of the turmoil that Wangji faces every time he looks at him, every second of the day. One day, Wei Ying will sleep and never wake up. One day, Wangji will be alone again.</p>

      <p>What will he do then?</p>

      <p>His inability to answer that makes him feel useless. He shudders out a breath and forces his gaze away from Wei Ying.</p>

      <p>He stiffly leaves the bed, reaching for a dressing gown that hangs nearby. Behind him, Wei Ying mumbles something in his sleep but thankfully does not wake up. He simply rolls over, hugging the closest pillow.</p>

      <p>Wangji's eyes soften. He leans down to kiss Wei Ying's cheek before turning away. Covering himself up, Wangji walks across the room and slips outside into the balcony, breathing in the cold air that washes over him. The city is as bright as ever. Wangji spots a few drunkards stumbling home, laughing into the night; he waits until they are gone, taking their noise and distraction with them.</p>

      <p>In the silence, he sighs and looks up. The city lights are far too bright for any stars to come out, but Wangji does not miss the solitary speck in the centre of the sky.</p>

      <p>A lone star, brighter than any of them, bright enough to rival the city lights.</p>

      <p>A nameless immortal whose real name has been forgotten by history; whose eyes are as black as the night sky, skin as pale as the moon. A nameless immortal who Wangji once met at a travelling circus many centuries ago, sharing her riddles with him.</p>

      <p>Wangji squints at the star. Another gust of wind envelops him, colder than the last. Like the human in the story, he too does not know her real name.</p>

      <p>Let us all spare a moment of silence for Lan Zhan who, after almost 3k years, has finally managed to nut. I hope he appreciates how much I suffered writing this chapter. Writing smut takes... so... much... effort.</p>
